					<description><![CDATA[Whenever I guest post, I do it because it makes me realize other people need to hear what I have to say about a specific topic or what I&#039;ve discovered that they can try in their life/business, or blog.

Plus, it&#039;s amazing to get feedback (comments and replies) from new, fresh, growing audiences

I&#039;m not doing it primarily for the link-building effect, but to SHARE the information (message, concept or idea) in which I believe in (causes worth spreading)

What about you guys?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post. Thank you for quoting me! I&#039;ve found blogging to be a great strategy to support your SEO efforts. Not only does blogging increase long tail search traffic to your website, but it helps people/companies demonstrate expertise. 

Now that social signals are influencing search results on Google and Bing, you&#039;ll want a solid blogging strategy. People using Twitter and Facebook generally like to share, &quot;Like&quot; or retweet current, non-commercial content. So if getting people to &quot;buzz&quot; about your business through these social channels is important to search, you&#039;ll need awesome, non-sales speak blog content to share. 

I also love guest blogging. Guest blogging is good for those that host the guest&#039;s content and for the guest. The guest poster gets to demonstrate expertise to a different audience. These opportunities also often come with signature links or short bios linking to the guest poster&#039;s social profiles. The blog host receives more content to drive long tail search traffic in addition to some new traffic from the guest poster&#039;s network as they&#039;ll likely share the post link on Twitter, Linkedin and/or Facebook. 

I could go on and on and on. The point is that blogging will help you demonstrate expertise, attract links, share socially, build your audience/network and drive long tail search traffic. Blog + You = WIN!]]></description>
