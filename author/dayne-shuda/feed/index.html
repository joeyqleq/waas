<p>Curiosity has many benefits. It seems that children are wired to be curious. They&#8217;re learning all kinds of new things. Watching my daughter grow up has been fun. She&#8217;s always asking questions. She&#8217;s always exploring things. At home. At the park. In the woods. It&#8217;s really neat to watch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of sparked my own curiosity.</p>
<p>I remember being the same way when I was a kid. I loved being outside. I loved reading. I loved listening to people talk about their lives. Including their work.</p>
<p>Not everyone keeps that curiosity as they grow older. But it seems that those that are able to keep at least some of it continue to learn and improve at a variety of aspects. Including their work.</p>
<h2>1. Ask yourself <em>why</em> the boss is asking you to do something.</h2>
<p><em>Why</em> is the biggest questions with curiosity. You obviously ask all the questions when it comes to being curious. But as an adult and in a work setting it seems that <em>why</em> is important. It helps you put yourself in the place of the other person.</p>
<p>So in the case of your boss, try to figure out whey they&#8217;re doing what they do. Assume they are a smart person and very good at their job. They are likely making the decision for a very good reason. Try to understand what the reasoning is. Talk to them about it. Try to listen and go into the situation with curiosity.</p>
<p>This can strengthen the relationship you have with your boss and it can lead to some great understanding of the job that can lead to better performance and advancement.</p>
<h2>2. Ask yourself <em>why</em> that coworker is acting a that way.</h2>
<p>Do the same thing with your coworkers. Try to get into their place to figure out how they see the world. Sit with them at lunch and get to know them. See if you can understand their motivation. At work. At life. The more you know the better that relationship will likely be.</p>
<p>And it should also lead to some good learning as well. You can learn from them. You can learn from just about all of your coworkers. About work, but also about life.</p>
<p>And if you have good relationships with the people you work with it will likely lead to better team outcomes. And that&#8217;s usually good for all involved.</p>
<h2>3. Ask yourself <em>why</em> you&#8217;re feeling this way about something.</h2>
<p>Now take some effort to see why you&#8217;re feeling a certain way. Why are you feeling apathetic to your work lately? Why are you feeling a certain way about your coworkers? Why can&#8217;t you do something? Why are you hesitant to learn the new process or software?</p>
<p>The more you understand yourself the better you can react in certain situations. And the better you can interact with your coworkers.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Curiosity is a great thing. Think about the people in your life that seem to have the most of it. They are probably pretty upbeat and happy most of the time. They&#8217;re also probably pretty smart on a number of topics. And they&#8217;re probably great in conversation. Mostly because they likely ask a lot of questions and do a lot of listening.</p>
<p>Hopefully these tips can help you to be more curious about your work.</p>

<p>Arguments are inevitable in any relationship. We argue with our parents, siblings, friends and significant others. It seems like at some point we learn to argue and then we never forget how to do it.</p>
<p>We also argue in the workplace.</p>
<p>Even with remote working we are still likely to argue with our coworkers.</p>
<p>The reason often comes down to having different goals. That can seem off in a work setting. Isn&#8217;t everyone trying to achieve the same success at their place of work? Well, it&#8217;s not always the same. You may have one goal for the organization and for yourself. Another person may have different goals. And even if the goal is the same, as set from a manager perhaps, you may have different ideas of how to achieve it, which is a variation of the goal.</p>
<p>Imagine a football team. The goal is to win the Super Bowl. But players often have different goals of how to achieve it. Usually with themselves as the focal point of the winning team. See: <a href="https://deadspin.com/i-aint-no-damned-monkey-on-a-string-the-sadness-of-s-5847019">Walter Payton after winning the Super Bowl</a>.</p>
<p>How can you use arguments in a positive way at work?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts&#8230;</p>
<h2>1. Take It Private</h2>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re in a group setting when an argument escalates. You might be in a meeting discussing strategy or something similar. You and another person start arguing. Perhaps one or both of you begins raising your voice.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>Especially if you&#8217;re passionate about how something is going to be done.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to try and reign in the emotion in that moment. You can continue discussing and finish the meeting. But try to meet up with the person and discuss the situation in private. You don&#8217;t want others concerned for team morale or things like that because of a heated argument.</p>
<h2>2. Discuss Goals Respectfully</h2>
<p>In private, discuss your goals with the person. Try to see where you&#8217;re align and don&#8217;t align on things. Really try to listen and understand what the other person is feeling and how they want to approach the situation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually in both of your interests to come to some agreement. Your higher ups likely don&#8217;t want you both feuding or disagreeing on everything. That&#8217;s not good for the organization and ultimately it won&#8217;t be for you and the other person either.</p>
<p>You can even do this preemptively. If you&#8217;re working with a new person on a project schedule time to meet with them and discuss your goals. Try to get ahead of arguments.</p>
<h2>3. Be Specific About Details</h2>
<p>Try not to use generals when you&#8217;re arguing or discussing your goals with someone. And try to avoid using &#8220;all-in&#8221; words like always, everyone, etc. It&#8217;s usually not <em>always</em> the case and it&#8217;s usually not <em>everyone</em> that is or isn&#8217;t doing something.</p>
<p>Take time to consider your own goals before the discussion too. This can help shore up the details so you&#8217;re confident in expressing yourself.</p>
<h2>4. Offer To Help Each Other</h2>
<p>Usually you can figure out common ground with arguments. You likely won&#8217;t ever share the exact same goals. But you can usually find a solution that is good for both of you. And you can even likely offer to help each other. It&#8217;s a way to work together for the good of both. And for the organization.</p>
<p>Say you both want a promotion. You&#8217;re working on a project. If it goes well you know that one of the two of you will likely get the promotion.</p>
<p>Help each other out. Worst case is you give each other the odds of 50/50. And the person that doesn&#8217;t get the promotion looks good and can maybe get a raise or perhaps find a similar promotion at another company.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Arguments will always happen. They&#8217;re not always a bad thing. But they can turn ugly and destructive for all involved including the observers. You want to try to use them for the positive. Turn them into constructive conversations. See if you&#8217;re able to work with the other person(s) to figure out why you have differing thoughts. It could be that you have different goals.</p>
<p>Try to find a solution that benefits you both.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen those drawings that offer to two different pictures or interpretations? Either you see two people looking at each other or you see an eaten apple. An old man or a young lady. A rabbit or a duck.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of those images floating around. They&#8217;re meant to test our perspective on the world. Often we can&#8217;t control what we see in the image.</p>
<p>How we approach the world and its changes are similar to looking at these images. The way we interpret what is happening around us will have an impact on our life and success.</p>
<p>At work, change will happen. If we don&#8217;t like the outcome it could be a result of the way we are looking at the situation.</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts on how to handle change at work.</p>
<h2>1. You&#8217;re Not Alone</h2>
<p>Sometimes when change occurs it can feel like it&#8217;s happening only to us. At work, maybe there have been one, two or more people that have left recently. That can cause more work for you, but also likely for others. It may be that you were friends with those that left. But if they were great people they probably had lots of other friends in the office.</p>
<p>Knowing that we&#8217;re not alone in the world is usually comforting. Knowing that others feel the same feelings and share the same experiences gives us reassurance that we can overcome and adapt. And it&#8217;s not just people living right now. Humans have been dealing with change forever. And no change that occurs today hasn&#8217;t occurred in the past.</p>
<h2>2. Think Back On Previous Change</h2>
<p>When things occur in the present it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the moment. We see the instant change occurring right now. It can be scary.</p>
<p>It can help to take a moment to think back on the last time change occurred in the office. Maybe someone is leaving now. When was the last time someone left? It helps to remember when things like this happened because we often forget. We adapt and move on.</p>
<p>This can be comforting. It helps us to know that we will get through the current change. We will figure out how to adapt. We will be ok.</p>
<h2>3. Happiness Isn&#8217;t Dependent On Outcomes</h2>
<p>It can seem that happiness comes from outcomes. And perhaps it&#8217;s true. We get a new job that we really worked hard for. We studied. We practiced interviewing. Or maybe you lost a certain amount of weight. You fee and look great. You worked really hard to eat better and to workout more.</p>
<p>The outcomes are wonderful. But attaching happiness to outcomes is tricky. The outcome is not always what we planned on happening, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>This is actually a driving force at Pixar, the giant movie studio. They often focus on stories where the protagonist wants a certain thing to occur, but in the end they get something different. Different, but still good and often better than they wanted.</p>
<p>In <em>Toy Story</em>, for example, Woody was going through all kinds of change. A big move. And a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Woody really didn&#8217;t want Buzz to join the gang. But in the end, Buzz became a great friend of Woody.</p>
<p>Change is happening. You may really want to go back. Or you may really want a certain outcome. Be open to what will happen. It could be better than you realize.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Change will happen in the workplace. The company will make changes. People will come and go. You know it will happen. It can help to realize that it will happen and to plan for it. And be open to the change. Think back on what has changed in the past. Things likely moved on and perhaps even improved. That can and will occur again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you understand the people that you're hiring? People rarely change. They can improve their skills. But who they are as a person doesn't often change. So knowing who you're working with and accepting that is often a key to success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_13714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13714" style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13714" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heart-In-The-Sand-300x200.jpg" alt="Heart In The Sand" width="300" height="200" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heart-In-The-Sand-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heart-In-The-Sand-768x512.jpg 768w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Heart-In-The-Sand.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13714" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@slimmanny12?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Victor Amenze</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hiring is one of the most important things for a business owner or manager. Hire the right people and you can trust them and count on them with the work they&#8217;re doing. They will help you grow the business in multiple ways.</p>
<p>But hiring is often more of an art than a skill. Sure, you can do your best to learn from experience and to build data points and key indicators. You can try to hire the same type of successful employees over and over.</p>
<p>But everyone is often different. Maybe not in major ways, but often in multiple little ways. And it&#8217;s your job to learn about who each person is and accept that. Instead of trying to change their core personality, trying to figure out the best way to integrate them into the team so it&#8217;s good for all involved.</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts on how to accept your employees for the people they are.</p>
<h2>1. Aim For Curiosity With Others</h2>
<p>Go into each encounter with your employees looking to learn more about them. You probably got some good first impressions when they first interviewed. That is when your understanding of them begins. But it&#8217;s important to continue to learn.</p>
<p>Try to watch and figure out what they do well and where they struggle. Determine if it&#8217;s something that can be learned or if it&#8217;s an inherent weakness that could perhaps be overcome in a unique way.</p>
<p>Remember, if they have been successful in various things in life they probably know a few ways to make themselves successful. See if they are able to come up with solutions that allow them to learn and to be good at their jobs.</p>
<h2>2. Challenge Them To Be Their Best</h2>
<p>You still want to challenge them to be their best. It&#8217;s been really interesting, as a Wisconsinite and Packers fan, to read about the players that played for Coach Vince Lombardi. He was hard on some players. He was easier on a few. But just about all of them talked about how he challenged them to be the best at their position and later on in life. He challenged them to be successful.</p>
<p>Try to keep setting goals for your employees. Make sure they&#8217;re seeing improvement so they stay motivated. It might take a little individual focus from you because not everyone is the same, but it can be worth this attention and effort.</p>
<h2>3. Set Basic Boundaries</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s good to set some basic boundaries with the employee. Just a line that they need to stay in while they&#8217;re trying to accomplish the goals of the company. These might be moral lines. They might be risk lines. That type of thing. You likely want to pay attention to the personality of each person when bringing them on board. If you&#8217;re hiring the right people then these boundaries will likely be build into their personality.</p>
<h2>4. Be Clear On Job Outcomes</h2>
<p>Outcomes are the key. You might be looking for people that will follow specific procedures. But for many businesses it&#8217;s more about outcomes. And if you have people that are innovative and different, they can often discover better ways of doing things. Then you can use the findings to help the entire team improve.</p>
<p>And also the key is boundaries. Outcomes are great, but not if they are achieved in ways that don&#8217;t align with your morals or even something that might harm the employees, like burnout.</p>
<h2>5. You Can Still Discuss Topics With Them</h2>
<p>You want to accept people. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that a good argument isn&#8217;t good from time to time. Challenge them on things where you feel strongly. But also be open to where they feel differently. You are probably not going to convince them to change in certain ways. And vice versa. But it&#8217;s good to let each other know where you stand and what is important to you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The most successful leaders are often those that aren&#8217;t trying to control everything. They don&#8217;t run a loose ship. They communicate with their team. They discuss goals. They try to be curious about who their people are. They try to hire people that fit the team. And they look for ways to give each individual the best chance of succeeding.</p>

<p>There are obviously balances that come with leading a business. As a manager, you have to train your team how to do their jobs. You have to give them some leeway while also being involved in what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>So micromanaging can come into play. And often it&#8217;s not because the manager wants to do it on person. It could be that they like to have control of certain situations. It could be that they truly believe they are the best person to perform certain tasks.</p>
<p>But micromanaging is usually not a long-term strategy. And it&#8217;s often doesn&#8217;t lead to good results both in the short nor long-term.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ill effects of being a micromanager in the workplace.</p>
<h2>1. Innovation Is Stunted</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s generally believed that the best outcomes in businesses and organizations come when a manager sets a goal and allows the team work toward it. There might be more to the framework, but that&#8217;s the general idea. And it&#8217;s the manager&#8217;s job to support and help the team in any way necessary.</p>
<p>This often leads to innovation. The team of individuals can bring ideas to the table. Old and new. Testing is often done.</p>
<p>But in a micromanager situation, the manager will often stay in their comfort zone. They will control what is done and often will do it themselves or have very strict control over their team.</p>
<p>One negative result is that often innovation is stunted. Often, team members with great ideas will look elsewhere as an outlet for their innovative thoughts.</p>
<h2>2. Learning is Stunted</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re doing exactly a process and only that process you&#8217;re not going to learn. You likely <em>want</em> to learn. But micromanaging bosses often like to control situations. They don&#8217;t want chaos. They don&#8217;t like changing roles and allowing people to expand their knowledge and experience. They like to keep things the way they have always been.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand. When things work we want them to continue working. That can work&#8230;to a point. But life moves forward and growth is important. Not just for the business, but for the individuals involved in the business.</p>
<h2>3. Blame Game</h2>
<p>Micromanagers don&#8217;t like to be wrong. They like the control. They like knowing that they have control of a situation. When something goes wrong, they often blame others. It could often be that they blame outside sources. But they will sometimes blame their team. It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s fault for not following a process exactly right. It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s fault for trying something different.</p>
<p>This can lead to burn out and discourse that obviously stifles growth.</p>
<h2>4. Negative Competition</h2>
<p>The manager might be the type of person that needs to be the &#8220;winner&#8221; in the business. No matter what they need to feel superior. And not just in their processes, but in everything. They may withhold information from their team so that they can be seen as superior. They made need that credit all the time.</p>
<p>This is like trying to have the tallest building in the city by destroying other buildings instead of actually trying to do what it takes to build the tallest building. It stifles everyone including the manager.</p>
<h2>5. Lose Interest From Outside Vendors, Colleagues, Customers, etc.</h2>
<p>Customers and others from outside of the organization can often quickly see when things aren&#8217;t going well. They can see micromanagers. People typically understand that negative things that occur in these situations and they steer clear.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve all likely dealt with micromanagers. Sometimes we&#8217;re able to get along fine. Other times it&#8217;s usually best to look for other options. And if you&#8217;re the one with the micromanaging tendencies, it&#8217;s important to understand the potential ill effects. You likely want to succeed. The best method is often giving others the autonomy to reach a goal that you set for them. It comes down to trust.</p>

<p>One major factor that leads to work discontent is another person that just seems to like stirring up trouble. They may try to make work difficult for others. They may try to just &#8220;have some fun&#8221; in the office, but really they&#8217;re just distracting.</p>
<p>Whatever they&#8217;re doing and for whatever reason, they&#8217;re just causing disturbance. And it&#8217;s probably affecting your work and others in the organization. It might not be to the point of them being fired, but it&#8217;s enough to cause issues.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can help to understand why someone might be acting this way. It could lead to a possible resolution that you can implement to change the situation for the better.</p>
<h2>1. Job Performance Issue &amp; Guilt</h2>
<p>Sometimes when we do poorly on a task or project we feel guilty. Others react more positively than others. Some will kind of dig in and figure out how to do better the next time. Others may not be exactly sure how to respond so they kind of act out. They may inadvertently cause some strife in the office with their negative behavior. They may seek some sort of validation for their poor performance. Trying to get others to tell them that they&#8217;re good at their job.</p>
<p>This can manifest in different ways. It could be a good sign that maybe the behavior is just temporary and that once the person gets back in a regular routine and performance that things will settle back down.</p>
<h2>2. Tallest Building Syndrome</h2>
<p>Some people are competitive. They want to be the best in the office or workplace. This can be a great thing especially if the person is a team player. They want to be the best or have the &#8220;tallest building&#8221; by building the tallest building. They see a challenge when others are doing well and they want to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>But others see tall buildings in the workplace and they take action by trying to tear down the other tall buildings so that they are the new tallest. This is obviously destructive. It&#8217;s not good for anyone including the person doing it. They may feel good in the short-term, but by bringing others around them down they are ultimately hurting the way they look on the bigger scale.</p>
<h2>3. Perceived Slight</h2>
<p>Promotions are great. Usually for those that get the promotion. And often for the people that will be working with the promoted person. If the person doing the promoting makes the right choice, it&#8217;s typically good for almost all involved.</p>
<p>But some may feel slighted. They may feel that they deserved the job. And this can obviously lead to some acting out. Maybe the person immediately starts pointing out the mistakes of the person that was promoted. Maybe in meetings. Maybe in one-on-ones. It leads to issues and either the person will have to get used to it or maybe they will need to look for a new job.</p>
<h2>4. General Change</h2>
<p>All companies and organizations go through change. For someone that has been there for a long time with little change, big change can be a real shock to the system. It could be that the person gets a new boss. It could be that the company is finally using a new software system. It could be any type of change.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t always react well to change. It takes us out of our comfort zone. And some people will kind of lash out or look for negative attention when change occurs.</p>
<p>The good news is that in most instances the person will find their new routine and things will kind of get back to normal for those around them.</p>
<h2>5. Something Personal</h2>
<p>And there could always be something going on in the person&#8217;s life outside the workplace. It&#8217;s difficult to know if this is the case, but if someone is struggling and causing issues, it&#8217;s good to give them a little benefit of the doubt. We never really know what someone is going through. Loss, struggle, all kinds of things.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not fun when someone is causing issues at work. It can make life difficult for those they&#8217;re working with. Knowing what the cause might be can help us to at least understand the situation. It may lead to a possible resolution. It could even lead to everyone coming out better in the end.</p>

<p>The way we interact with coworkers has a lot to do with our job success, fulfillment and happiness. Sometimes a relationship with someone at work is poor because the other person isn&#8217;t a good person. But there can be other reasons. And some of those reasons could fall on you.</p>
<p>Are you struggling to connect with your coworkers? Do you wish you had better relationships?</p>
<p>The right attitude in the workplace can lead to many good things. People generally want to be around others that are positive. And usually the best people are attracted to those that are positive.</p>
<p>So having the right attitude is a key. It&#8217;s not the only thing that matters, but it&#8217;s very important.</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts on how to improve your attitude so you can attract better people to your circle in the office and form quality relationships.</p>
<h2>1. How does your history affect your outlook on life?</h2>
<p>Some of us go through our early life with lots of challenges. People let us down over and over. Especially those that are supposed to care about us the most. This can have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>Our history can affect how we anticipate others to treat us and how we expect life to treat us. It&#8217;s no wonder some people have a negative outlook on the future.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to understand that the past doesn&#8217;t need to be the future. And now that you&#8217;re an adult you&#8217;re in much more control of who you interact with, what you do and even what happens to you. Sure, you can&#8217;t control everything, but you can work to put yourself in better situations.</p>
<p>And part of that is putting out a good attitude that attracts others with good attitudes.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to interact with negative people.</p>
<h2>2. Is the need for control key to your outlook?</h2>
<p>Some of us have a need to control life. Maybe it&#8217;s because part of our life in the past was out of control. Or maybe it&#8217;s just something that was ingrained in us from birth. Whatever the case, a need for control can lead to a negative attitude that turns others away.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t like to be controlled. When we work with others this can become an issue. It&#8217;s our way or the highway. Not everyone responds well to this and it can leave you alienated. Especially from those that we benefit from working with.</p>
<h2>3. Most situations have some kind of winning outcome</h2>
<p>A key to a good attitude is seeing the good that comes out of situations. Obviously we can all think of horrible things that have happened to us. These definitely occur.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s say a project at work doesn&#8217;t come out like you want. The boss isn&#8217;t happy. It can be a learning occasion at minimum. These often are the things that really stick in your memory to avoid in the future. They can provide motivation. They can make you better.</p>
<p>Being better at your job is usually a good thing.</p>
<h2>4. Serendipity is there if you look for it</h2>
<p>Another part of finding the good at work and in life is being open to serendipity. Being open to meeting and working with new people. Some of our best relationships are often from little events. Things we don&#8217;t give much thought to going in.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are with folks I met the first day of college. Just chance meetings. Others are from my adult life when I happen to sit next to another parent at an after school event.</p>
<p>You just never know when good things will happen. But going into every situation, including at work, with the idea that something good may happen is a great way to go about life. If you expect good, you&#8217;ll often find good.</p>
<h2>5. Watch for those that will take advantage of your energy</h2>
<p>One thing to watch for when changing your attitude is folks that will press you for your energy. It won&#8217;t happen often and many that do this don&#8217;t do it with poor intent. They just see that you&#8217;re awesome to work with so they want to work with you as much as possible.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably awesome at your job, but even you have limits to your time and energy. You&#8217;re going to have to learn to tell people no. That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re negative. It just means that you know yourself and know your limits.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Think of your work history. Who were the coworkers you enjoyed the most? I&#8217;d bet they had the best, most positive attitudes. We are drawn to folks like this. We want to work with them. They are probably successful because others want to work with them.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re struggling with relationships at work, consider your attitude. See if there is room for change. Positive change.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Body language is important in just about all aspects of life. Including while we're working.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12850" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/White-Board-Meeting-Office-267x200.jpg" alt="White Board Meeting Office" width="267" height="200" srcset="https://ghostblogwriters.com/wp-content/uploads%5D%5D%3E%3C!%5BCDATA%5B/2020/05/White-Board-Meeting-Office-267x200.jpg 267w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/White-Board-Meeting-Office-768x576.jpg 768w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/White-Board-Meeting-Office.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" />Most of what we present of ourselves to the world is not with our voice. Certainly the words we speak carry weight. It&#8217;s often the things we give the least through to that could hit home with someone.</p>
<p>But it seems that what really sticks with people is the non-verbal. The body language we present to others. Most animals in the world communicate more with non-verbal than with verbal. They use their different senses to take note of what&#8217;s going on around them and how to react.</p>
<p>I enjoy spending time in the woods. We have a lot of whitetail deer here in Wisconsin. I like watching how they interact with each other. They certainly have verbal communication. But what&#8217;s really fascinating is their body language. How a young fawn can pick up on its mother&#8217;s body language in a certain situation.</p>
<p>Humans are the same way. Body language is important in just about every scenario we face. It&#8217;s very important in work environments.</p>
<p>Do you feel that you&#8217;re giving off the wrong vibes at work?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts that may help.</p>
<h2>1. Model Those You Admire</h2>
<p>Work is a great setting for learning from others. Coworkers, vendors, just about anyone you come into contact with is someone you can learn from. Not just about work and success, but also about their communication skills. Start focusing on those you look up to and admire. Focus on their non-verbal communication. The way they move. The way they sit and stand when they&#8217;re with others. Begin modeling their behavior so it becomes comfortable for you. It will seem strange and uncomfortable at first, but the more you do it the better you&#8217;ll become and you should see others reacting differently to you.</p>
<h2>2. Learn What Turns You Off About Others</h2>
<p>While you&#8217;re observing the non-verbal skills of those around you, focus on those that you don&#8217;t really admire. Maybe they annoy you. Maybe they aren&#8217;t doin good work. It could be that part of the issue is that they struggle with non-verbal communication. See what they&#8217;re doing. See how they act in certain situations that really turn you off. It&#8217;s good to learn what not to do as much as it&#8217;s good to learn what is good.</p>
<h2>3. Find Your Confidence</h2>
<p>Confidence is very important when it comes to non-verbal communication. Others can tell when you&#8217;re feeling confident. It&#8217;s an attraction. Not just romantically, but for many reasons. We like being around those that have an appropriate level of confidence. Think about times you&#8217;ve been confident. Try to find hobbies or skills at work that make you confidence. Do those things when you&#8217;re feeling like you need a little boost.</p>
<h2>4. Focus On Eye Contact For Better Listening</h2>
<p>Eye contact is really important. It&#8217;s something I struggle with. It could be related to confidence for some people. I&#8217;ve wondered if it has to do with introversion. People tend to wear me out after awhile. I&#8217;ve found that avoiding eye contact helps me to keep my energy levels up a bit. But I realize that it can have a lot of negative effects. So I need to focus on eye contact to show others that I care about what they&#8217;re saying. People want to be heard. Show them you&#8217;re listening and they&#8217;ll lean into the conversation.</p>
<h2>5. Practice Appropriate Spacing</h2>
<p>Spacing is key for interaction with others. Get too far away and it seems awkward. Get too close and the same is true. Some seem to have a natural feel for appropriate spacing. Others have to work a bit at it. Modeling others can be a good thing, but really it&#8217;s practicing. If you feel others stepping away, listen to their cues. Try to get a handle on each situation so you learn what works and what gets other engaged.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Non-verbal communication, body language, is important in work environments. If you&#8217;re getting the vibe from others that they&#8217;re not comfortable with you it could be a body language issue. There are things you can practice. There are things you can learn about yourself that bring out confidence. It&#8217;s worth the effort to investigate because making connections with others is important. Especially with our work.</p>

<p>We spend a lot of time with our co-workers, our bosses, our colleagues and more. Work relationships are a large part of our adult life.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all probably worked with people that we love. And we have probably worked with a few folks that we didn&#8217;t get along with.</p>
<p>And sometimes we may have experienced a situation where someone started avoiding us. That one can throw you off sometimes. It can be hurtful and frustrating. It can feel like you&#8217;re missing out on something valuable.</p>
<p>How do you avoid killing worthwhile work relationships?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts&#8230;</p>
<h2>1. Dealbreakers</h2>
<p>Everyone has dealbreakers. We usually talk about them in the context of personal relationships. We have them with our partners. When we&#8217;re dating we&#8217;re usually well aware of our dealbreakers. It may take a relationship or two (or more) to really learn what is not going to work for us.</p>
<p>Everyone has slightly different dealbreakers. It could be timeliness, reliability, the type of words you use in regular conversation and lots more. We usually have a couple of things that are really important to us.</p>
<p>Early on in a work relationship we may let a few things slide, but as time goes on we often realize whether a coworker is someone we want to spend time with or not. And if there is a choice, we probably look to avoid those that we don&#8217;t want to mix with.</p>
<h2>2. The Energy Balance</h2>
<p>There are different balances in most relationships. The relationships that work the best usually find the correct balance. What one person needs, the other provides. And vice versa. If one side is taking more than the other is comfortable with in regards to a certain aspect, things can get off balance. And from there things can quickly or slowly start to erode.</p>
<p>Energy seems to be key in work relationships. One person requires time and energy. Another is willing to give. But if the balance is abused it can lead to a total loss.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say for example that you and a coworker are working on a project. You kind of fall into a rhythm of how the work is balanced. It seems to be going well, but soon the other person is requesting a reassignment. They may have thought the balance was off and not at all in their favor.</p>
<p>Communication is key to finding the right balance. Even if you feel that things are going well.</p>
<h2>3. Controlling Tendencies</h2>
<p>Whatever the cause, some of us have controlling tendencies. Without even realizing it we may exert control over a situation and that could include work and our coworkers. If some relationships at work have been suffering consider looking into how you control situations. Do you micromanage others? Do you try to exert your will over the direction of certain projects?</p>
<p>Look at how you&#8217;ve worked with others. If you make them feel overly controlled in certain ways it could be the cause for issue.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not fun to lose important relationships at work. And sometimes it&#8217;s out of our control. But if you feel that you might be turning others away, look at the reasons listed here. You don&#8217;t often need to entirely change as a person or a coworker. But you can work on a few things to bring more to those you work with and thus attract more healthy relationships.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that a few people can skew our views on the world. Most people that we encounter in life are wonderful. They&#8217;re nice. They&#8217;re kind. They have your best interests in mind when they&#8217;re interacting with you. They&#8217;re willing to help you. They&#8217;re willing to listen.</p>
<p>But once in awhile you&#8217;ll come across someone that is just not a good person. They&#8217;re mean. They&#8217;ve vindictive. Who knows what happened in their lives that made them this way.</p>
<p>Another unfortunate aspect of life is that it can be difficult to get away from these people. Let&#8217;s say you work at a place that you enjoy. But one or two people make things uncomfortable or difficult.</p>
<p>What can you do in these situations?</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts&#8230;</p>
<h2>1. Review The Employee Handbook</h2>
<p>Boundaries could be needed for all sorts of things. If you&#8217;re in immediate trouble it&#8217;s good to get out of the situation. If you&#8217;re not in immediate need, but need to make changes, consult the handbook. It&#8217;s good to know the rules the company has set out. It&#8217;s probably not the first time an employee has encountered a bad situation. It&#8217;s unfortunate, but usually employers have taken the time to think things through. They want the good employees to feel safe, respected and heard.</p>
<h2>2. Talk To Your Boss</h2>
<p>Next, talk to your boss. Explain the situation. Reiterate that you&#8217;re looking to do a good job for them. You want what&#8217;s best for the company, but that means that you need to feel that you&#8217;re able to do your best. Try to come to the meeting with a proposed solution. Think about it from their perspective. They likely want to keep you on board. But they also have to think about the entire company. Try to find a solution that is good for all parties.</p>
<h2>3. Rearrange Your Schedule and Routines</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re in control. You can probably figure out a way to create a boundary with a person that is causing you stress. Maybe you run into them walking into the office or at lunch or leaving the office. They make comments that bother you. It could be anything. Or maybe you&#8217;re working on a project with them.</p>
<p>Look for what you control in the situation. You can&#8217;t really force them to change. But you can probably change something in your routine that alters the situation. If it&#8217;s a project, talk to your boss about it. See if there is a way to change things up. Tell them what&#8217;s happening. Focus on trying to find the right solution for the company.</p>
<h2>4. Discuss Priorities With Your Boss</h2>
<p>Your boss could be piling on too much work. Not that they do it intentionally. They see you doing great work. They see that you can be relied upon. They ask you to do little things. But those add up.</p>
<p>It could be that you need to set boundaries with your boss.</p>
<p>Talk to them about priorities. They understand time management. Make them discuss the most important tasks that you need to work on. They will likely start to see that things have crept into your daily routine that shouldn&#8217;t be there. They will likely take the lead on cutting things out that aren&#8217;t important.</p>
<h2>5. Look For Another Job</h2>
<p>If it comes to it, look for another job. If you feel that you&#8217;ve done what you can to change the situation, but it&#8217;s just not changing, then look for a way out. It can be difficult. But you&#8217;re a good person and good worker. There are always opportunities for folks like you.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Talking to the people you work with is the key to boundaries. Assert what&#8217;s important to you. It&#8217;s okay to be honest with people. If you&#8217;re doing good work the rest will usually fall into place as long as you express what you want in return for your effort. And if that&#8217;s not be respected, you&#8217;re better off going somewhere else.</p>
