					<description><![CDATA[In my experience, comments are easy for small businesses to answer questions by customers. Easier then answering mail questions. And feedback by customers shows that they love reading questions by other customers and the answers. It&#039;s like a collaborative blogpost.

I actually prefer engaging customers through comment sections then through twitter sessions. Twitter conversations disappear in no time.

Does that mean that a post without comments is a failure? I don&#039;t think so. I read many great blogposts without writing a comment.

Views and links are not the main goal of small businesses when blogging in my opinion, two main objectives are most important: gaining trust with your potential customers and giving them the ability to look around without feeling obliged to buy anything.

Views and links lead to money if the customer finds what he thinks he or she needs. I think the  most important added value of the comment conversations is the sense of collaboration and trust.]]></description>
