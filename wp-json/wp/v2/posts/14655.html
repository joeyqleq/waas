Anyone with authority or power to make decisions and control the efforts of others was called a \u201cleader.\u201d Of course, there were some true gems in there, with a deeper understanding of impactful and thoughtful leadership, changing the lives of others for the better. But a lot of folks with a title held positions of business leadership that had no rightly business being there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s leaders are not &lt;em&gt;those&lt;\/em&gt; old-school bosses of yesteryear.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s business leaders are defined as those &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/study.com\/academy\/lesson\/what-is-business-leadership.html#:~:text=A%20person%20who%20leads%20the,%2C%20and%203\"&gt;who provide leadership&lt;\/a&gt; to organizational employees and vendors with the purpose of collectively chaperoning the group to success that aligns with the company objectives. In short, great leaders are those who support and guide individuals and teams in a way that benefits the individuals and the company together.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The duties might look the same as the leaders of the past. Today\u2019s empower-ers are still responsible for making critical company or departmental decisions. They\u2019re in charge of developing and implementing goal-driven initiatives. And they\u2019re still charged with managing employees. But it\u2019s how today\u2019s leaders execute on these tasks that differs and sets them apart as revolutionary leaders.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What Distinguishes a Good Leader from a Bad Leader Today?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to build, grow, or maintain a company in today\u2019s economic environment is tedious. It\u2019s far more complex now to manage employees, sell products and services, and expand into new markets. It\u2019s fast-paced, too, with mission-critical decisions demanding your attention every minute of every day. And the stakes are higher since one delayed decision could cost thousands. Under these kinds of pressures, the greatest leaders emerge, and they all have the same roster of key characteristics\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrity&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Courage&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Empathy&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-Awareness&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Respect&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asking around, you\u2019ll find that employees hold leaders in the highest regard when they\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a variety of skill sets needed for the job&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong and transparent communication skills&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are emotionally intelligent to the needs and preferences of their subordinates&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inspire people to be the best version of themselves&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motivate individuals and the collective group effectively&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Why Leadership Skills Are Important for Owners and Managers&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cultivating and improving your leadership skills, whether you\u2019re a business owner or a departmental manager, is important for several reasons. In addition to making decisions and managing staff, you\u2019re responsible for other pivotal responsibilities. Explore these distinctions to see how you&amp;#8217;re doing right now with your current leadership methods.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will give orders. A great leader will inspire action.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will delegate tasks. A great leader will share the vision behind the tasks.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will control staff. A great leader will motivate teams.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will compete internally. A great leader will build relationships.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will avoid risks. A great leader will assess and embrace risks.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A marginal leader will be content with the status quo. A great leader will challenge thinking and learn new solutions.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s businesses need great leaders to facilitate growth, adaptability, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-scaling-your-business-in-2023\/\"&gt;and scaling&lt;\/a&gt;. It\u2019s just that simple. And it&amp;#8217;s why as a leader yourself, these new leadership skills, methods, styles, and strategies should matter to you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Do You Possess Great Leadership Qualities?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding what today\u2019s revolutionary leaders do differently and why these types of leaders are important in business, you can now turn inward. Reflect on your own skills and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbeshumanresourcescouncil\/2021\/12\/30\/the-three-cs-of-leadership\/#:~:text=My%20training%20and%20experiences%20in,%3A%20competence%2C%20commitment%20and%20character.\"&gt;leadership characteristics&lt;\/a&gt;. Get honest about assessing your leadership qualities. And if any of these qualities are missing from your leadership style, you know precisely what needs improvement.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentic Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most respected leaders always lead from a position of authenticity. This management style trusts employees. These leaders are transparent and honest about their own motivations as they guide and support others with theirs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathetic Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.tonyrobbins.com\/what-is-leadership\/empathetic-leadership-style\/\"&gt;famed Tony Robbins&lt;\/a&gt; often talks about empathetic leadership as the most impactful leadership style. These individuals are open and sensitive to the experiences, views, and opinions of others. They\u2019re naturally curious and make decisions with a complete understanding of how those results impact others around them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptable Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Innovative leaders are always reevaluating their positions and discovering better solutions. They\u2019re not only comfortable with change, they crave it, always seeking a more efficient strategy. These leaders can often handle any challenge or workplace dynamic before them without missing a step.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competent Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Great leaders aren\u2019t just all personality. They\u2019re highly skilled for the role of leadership. Competent leaders tap into their knowledge, skills, and experiences and are typically self-disciplined to a tee. They\u2019re also regularly embracing new ideas, education, and training to grow their competencies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment-Driven Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do as I do. Commitment-driven leaders are doers and often inspire others to make similar workplace commitments. The best leaders won\u2019t ask anyone to do something they don\u2019t believe in or wouldn\u2019t do themselves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character-Inspired Leadership&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Be honest and get comfortable with your own unique experiences and beliefs. Great leaders embrace these characteristics, good and bad, in a way that informs how they manage and support others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Different Leadership Styles for Different Leaders&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the most effective and transformative leaders of today\u2019s business environment have many of the aforementioned characteristics and skills, your leadership style can be unique. Every leader has a style. And it\u2019s best to stick with the methods and strategies that best complement your style, personality, and uniqueness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/leadership-styles#:~:text=The%20democratic%20leadership%20style%20is,you%20will%20hear%20their%20feedback\"&gt;HubSpot lays out&lt;\/a&gt; several of the various leadership styles of today\u2019s most profound leaders. Explore these and decide which (or combination thereof) you identify with the most.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Decisions are based on input from others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autocratic Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Decisions are derived from a single source.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laissez-Faire Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Decisions come from employees individually&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Decisions are based on goals and strategies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformational Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Driven to work and think in new ways.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transactional Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Employees are rewarded for jobs well done.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coaching Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Encourages and nurtures individuals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bureaucratic Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Decisions are rooted in company policies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visionary Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Energetic enthusiasm and focus on the future.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacesetting Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Setting aggressive and ambitious goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situational Leadership:&lt;\/strong&gt; Leadership styles and decisions are addressed uniquely by the specific situation at hand.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Taking Action to Transform Into a Great Leader&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you\u2019re ready to take action and transform your leadership initiatives, there are great first steps to explore. Recognizing how you can improve is only half the \u201crevolutionary\u201d leadership battle. Now it\u2019s time to put some verbs on your to-do list and execute your leadership transformation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find an Inspirational Role Model or Mentor to Follow&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s always best to find and follow another great leader you admire. Do your homework to discover a great leadership example with many of the same experiences, personality traits, or industry scenarios. Reach out and ask questions. And always be a sponge in learning new perspectives and strategies for successful leadership.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct a Current Positioning Survey and Leadership Assessment&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leadership assessments are great tools for honing your managerial strengths. These efforts can boost your self-awareness, too. Get feedback from your teams anonymously about what they love or dislike about the current leadership styles. Uncover immediate needs they might have so you can prioritize resolutions. Don\u2019t be too proud to take criticism, either, or you\u2019ll never transform into a revolutionary leader.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with One Person, Today&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t just make a leadership improvements to-do list and let it collect dust on a corner of your desk. Take action right now by seeking out one team member who needs your help today. Find one person who could use additional support or reassurance and then BE what they need. Build action-driven leadership momentum that starts with intentional assistance, one employee at a time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Proactive About Seeking Out Leadership Opportunities&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a truly transformative leader, you\u2019re going to need to be proactive about seeking new opportunities to demonstrate great leadership. Be liberal about doling out credit where credit is due. Be encouraging to your teams during long work days or difficult projects. And always be available to roll up your sleeves and help when your teams need it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Leadership Outside of Work&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Great leaders aren\u2019t just pivotal at the office or on the job. They\u2019re usually inspiring and motivating others in all aspects of their lives. Look for ways to practice great leadership elsewhere, with friends, at church, or within your community. Live a life where strong leadership values and skills transcend the workplace and positively impact every corner of your world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Steps to Get Organized&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might look at your messy desk and think it\u2019s organized chaos. But it\u2019s not organized, and you\u2019re not inspiring anyone else to get organized when your office space appears cluttered. Take steps now to bring organization to your life, including that messy desk. Great leaders are organized and inspire others to maintain schedules and order in their work. The more organized you are, the easier it\u2019s going to be to multi-task projects and work. And data suggests that when a company is led by an organized leader, the entire team is more likely to perform efficiently and function like a well-oiled machine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust and Delegate&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s another action step you can take right now, but it might be challenging at first. The greatest leaders today recognize that they can\u2019t achieve success by themselves. You\u2019re going to need to tag in other employees and managers who can grow with you and exceed collective goals. It can be tough to hand over the reins, especially if you\u2019ve been in control of them for any length of time. But you\u2019re going to have to trust and delegate others to join your efforts. Doing so will only bolster your results. And you\u2019ll allow others to step forward and build their leadership skills.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Share Your Leadership Knowledge and Journey&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most innovative of today\u2019s leaders don\u2019t hoard their knowledge and skills. They instead share their expertise and experience for the benefit of others. As a business owner or manager, you have an opportunity to impact a broader audience. Thought leadership isn\u2019t just about teaching new concepts or sharing new ideas. It\u2019s also about sharing lessons learned, mistakes, and decisions that led to some of your biggest breakthroughs. Don\u2019t hog your success and expertise. Share your leadership journey and inspire others. Here are just a few ways you can do just that:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Volunteer to be a guest speaker at a local event.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Share your stories within your networking groups.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create thought leadership content, including blogs and videos online.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write a book about your leadership journey.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Start Your Leadership Transformation&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s leaders are different from those of past generations. Being a leader in today\u2019s business landscape, with its complex and ever-changing elements, requires a new playbook for success.
