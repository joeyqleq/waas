Read on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Pay Attention to Trending Hashtags&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At first brush, this will seem like trite advice. If you can newsjack, use trending hashtags in your tweets, comment on popular tweets, and so on, you will see your account grow. Ever heard that before?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it\u2019s not untrue, but it\u2019s not strategic, and the growth you do experience will probably be slow.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To offer a specific example, I keep a close watch on the #WritingCommunity, #writerslift, and #BookTwitter hashtags (because I\u2019m a writer).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tweets marked with these tags are almost always highly engaged, as they encourage the sharing of blog posts and books in the community.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve even created a tweet of my own, that rolls out on a weekly basis, to encourage similar sharing. Usually, I see anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 impressions on these tweets. I always see my following increase too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Look for highly engaged hashtags in your niche or industry for best results.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Build Your Inner Community&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to grow on Twitter, don\u2019t go it alone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether it\u2019s personal contacts, influencers, other brands, or otherwise, look for connections you can collaborate with to grow each other\u2019s accounts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s nothing quite like a retweet when it comes to growing your Twitter presence, because it boosts your tweets in the algorithm and increases your visibility (especially since you\u2019ll be showing up on other people\u2019s accounts).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, build your inner community, and agree to retweet each other\u2019s posts, once per day, or once every other day, for maximum benefit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Buy More Attention Strategically&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, one of the best ways to grow your account is with retweets. Using trending hashtags can help you grow. Getting retweets from your inner community can also help you grow.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But one thing many digital marketers don\u2019t realize is they can also buy retweets. And, in this case, we\u2019re not just talking about &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/which-side-of-the-paid-ads-fence-are-you-on\/\"&gt;ads&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The idea here would be to look for accounts with a following that\u2019s a step or two ahead of yours. Reach out to them directly and ask them how much they would charge for a retweet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you should only need to spend $30 to $60, and if you\u2019re spending more, it should only be for a retweet from a bigger, much more engaged account.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Growing on Twitter will seem like an uphill battle until you figure out a few things. Tweeting more alone will only take you so far. You\u2019ve got to use relevant hashtags, build your inner community, and pay for more attention to maximize your growth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about Twitter\u2019s future and whether it\u2019s even relevant to marketers anymore.
