But hear me out on this one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether summer represents a busy time for you or a slow down in business, it\u2019s still a great time of year to be networking. It might be the best season of all for meeting and greeting your top&lt;img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14185 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/anna-demianenko-X912jiy57JU-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/anna-demianenko-X912jiy57JU-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/anna-demianenko-X912jiy57JU-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/anna-demianenko-X912jiy57JU-unsplash-1.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/&gt; prospects. Some of the best connections can be over a round of golf, sitting outside for a patio lunch, and handshaking at local ribbon-cutting ceremonies. And all of those scenarios, and a few others, make summer the best time to get connecting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;People Are Just Happier with a Little Vitamin D&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some people prefer the snowy winter months. But everyone can fall susceptible to the winter blues. There is scientific evidence proving that sunshine makes us happier. And as a business leader and entrepreneur, you can use this science to your benefit when you\u2019re networking. Getting outside more, being active, and enjoying summer activities just makes\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/how-to-find-joy-in-your-work\/\"&gt;everyone a little happier&lt;\/a&gt;. So, gathering with others for a community social hour or chamber outing might be more fun. And when everyone\u2019s in good spirits, you\u2019re more relaxed about making strategic connections.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;More Consistent Weather&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Weather matters, especially when you\u2019re trying to plan get-togethers and networking events. So, during\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/fireballnetwork.com\/summer-is-the-best-time-to-network\/\"&gt;the summer months&lt;\/a&gt;, when the breeze is balmy, and the sun is bright more often, it\u2019s the best time to plan those events or attend scheduled networking events. Sure, the rain will delay the occasional golf outing. But ultimately, look for more events to pop up through the summer months. Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to step outside your networking comfort zone and get out there! The weather won&amp;#8217;t likely be any better than it is right now!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Volunteer Opportunities Abound&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of great weather is that it\u2019s also perfect for fundraising and volunteer events. Look for charitable organizations in your neck of the woods that might be asking for help. You can gather up some of your colleagues or join an already planned initiative. Maybe you\u2019re pitching in on a local festival or helping assemble new playground equipment. I remember volunteering at the local animal shelter that was busy adding onto its facility. We cleaned kennels and painted sheds. And it was a community event that helped the shelter, allowed us all to get out of the office, and put us in a position to network with some of our biggest client prospects.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;More Outdoor Activities&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Networking doesn\u2019t have to be confined to a stuffy conference room or lunch venue. During the summer months, there are tons of outdoor activities you can tap into as prime networking real estate. Some of the most ground-breaking business conversations can take place at the beach, on the golf course, and during local festivals. Take advantage of these increased activities to find new ways and places to connect with those who can help grow your business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Casual Environments Translate to Relaxing Networking Opportunities&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Summer presents opportune times for a little rest and relaxation. It\u2019s time for flip-flops and Hawaiian shirts. Sunglasses and convertible hair are expected. And when people are more relaxed, networking becomes more casual and agreeable. Lose the suits and ties and have some fun this summer. Shake hands and start having more authentic conversations. Let your guard down and watch those casual conversations translate into strategic relationships.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;There Is Often More Downtime&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/exclusive-executive-resumes.com\/heres-how-summer-is-the-best-time-for-networking\/\"&gt;During the summer&lt;\/a&gt;, more people venture out on vacation and take time off of work. It can be harder to pin people down for appointments and meetings. But during their downtime, they\u2019ll be looking to do more recreational things with their time. And meeting up with people at local fairs, community celebrations, and sporting events can provide you with the meeting opportunities you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get with a formal appointment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Summer Events to Look to Add to Your Calendar&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re looking to get into your networking groove this summer, there are some events and get-together opportunities you can look for on the community calendars. Dot your schedule with a few of these and try to identify which events your top prospects might be attending. And who knows. You might even close a few deals while you\u2019re at it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Volunteer and Charity Events&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Check with your local non-profit organizations and ask about upcoming fundraisers or events. You can find volunteer opportunities, too, with your local Chamber of Commerce or BNI group. There might be industry associations in your region that put on events, as well. Find a way to give back, and you\u2019ll likely bump into other business leaders doing the same.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Ribbon Cuttings&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take every advantage to demonstrate support for businesses in your community by attending the summer ribbon-cutting ceremonies and celebrations. Local chamber organizations will usually schedule these, so keep up with those calendars. Other business leaders will also be in attendance, making it a great time to network.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Golf Tournaments&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you don\u2019t play golf, remember that your target prospects probably do. Get involved in amateur tournaments and fundraising golf outings. Be a sponsor. Drive the drink cart. Meet and mingle. Just don\u2019t try to talk to anyone when they\u2019re teeing up for a drive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Happy Hours&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Find the local hotspots for happy hours, especially those with patio settings or live entertainment on the schedule. Invite some friends and colleagues. But be prepared to meet and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/10-ways-to-improve-your-communication-in-every-engagement\/\"&gt;network with business contacts&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0who\u2019ll also be eager to relax with a cool beverage and enjoy a band.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Holiday and Seasonal Festivities&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Memorial Day, July 4th, and even Labor Day all make for reasons to celebrate in almost any community. Look for social event gatherings and festivals that bring local leaders, businesses, and families together. Attend those with intentions of having some fun yourself, but also meeting a few people and exchanging business cards.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sporting Events&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you network, sporting events might be a great networking summer event option. Major league games or minor league tournaments are always a good time, especially when entertaining prospects and clients. And scoring tickets or booking the box seats could be just the thing you need to attract the best.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Wine Tours&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Summertime is wine time! Local wineries offer recreational and celebratory wine tours as well as casual outdoor settings for get-togethers. Check your local wineries for their summer schedules and venture out for some sipping and mingling.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Patio Lunches&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you were to name the top five or ten restaurants in your neck of the woods with the best patio ambiance, what would they be? Now bookmark their websites and pencil in some time to enjoy them. If they\u2019re your favorite places for dining and patio atmospheres, they\u2019ll likely be favorites of other business leaders, too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Concert Events&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Summer is also an incredible time for various concerts and outdoor music events. Discover festivals or concerts in the park that may draw crowds. It\u2019ll be fun to hear new bands and see new performers. But you can also gain business advantages when you run into some of your top prospects there, too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Summer Networking Tips to Make the Most of Your Efforts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even in the most casual of networking settings, you\u2019ll want to be prepared. Bring your business cards. Prepare some icebreakers. And know what you plan to do should you score a one-on-one conversation with your biggest client prospect. Here are some\u00a0&lt;em&gt;definitely dos&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;em&gt;definitely don\u2019ts&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0to consider.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitely Do:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Definitely ask lots of questions. People are more comfortable talking about themselves and topics they enjoy. Initial networking conversations are about putting prospects at ease about talking with you. Trust comes when there is a comfortable exchange, usually centered around them.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do practice your elevator pitch describing what you do for a living. There\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than a big-fish contact asking you what you do, and you\u2019re left unprepared, jumbling marbles in your mouth. Practice how you would respond to that inquiry so when the time comes, you\u2019re ready to deliver a home run response.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Definitely be prepared to exchange numbers. Don\u2019t embark on a networking event without your business cards. Take it a step further by handwriting \u201cgive me a call\u201d or \u201cthank you\u201d on your business cards ahead of time for a personal touch.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitely Don\u2019t:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It\u2019s important to remember that being overtly in their face won\u2019t leave a favorable impression. If you\u2019re somewhere recreational, they\u2019re not likely thinking about work either. Be assertive with your introduction, but don\u2019t be over-intrusive or aggressive about gaining a work advantage. Remember, you\u2019re developing a relationship, so stick with creating a bond, not a sale.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t ignore cues that someone is disinterested. Nothing is more annoying than someone who keeps talking about something you\u2019re done listening to, right? Read the audience. If they\u2019re tuning out, it\u2019s time to zip it up.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t go into these summer social events with a hard-fast mission to get appointments or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/5-traits-of-a-successful-entrepreneur-in-2022\/\"&gt;collect business cards&lt;\/a&gt;. Instead, go in with a plan to make introductions and have conversations. The appointments and business cards will come later.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t be a salesy stalker. Yes, be where your people are going to be. Make the introductions. But keep it casual and friendly. Opportunities for more in-depth conversations will happen naturally if you keep it cordial, relaxed, and informal.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Networking Follow-Up Is Still Important&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you\u2019re networking in the summer or the winter months, follow-up is key. But when you\u2019ve recently spent quality time with someone in a summer social setting, you have an incredible opening for your follow-up email or phone call. \u201cIt was great hanging out with you\u201d is going to draw on the memories you made. And that\u2019s what will provide the inside channel you need to ask for the appointment or business-related conversation. Start with brief, short messages, opening the dialogue. Then, after you receive the response, you can move into asking the next-step questions. Maintaining contact after the event, even if it\u2019s just to invite them to another summer outing, is how you\u2019ll grow your network of strategic relationships.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;But What If You Think You\u2019re Terrible at Networking?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, when you go to a networking event, stop calling it \u201cnetworking.\u201d It\u2019s actually relationship development and making introductions. The term \u201cnetworking\u201d can make anyone with the slightest social anxiety cringe, at least according to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/09\/the-awkward-persons-guide-to-networking\"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;\/a&gt;. But it doesn\u2019t have to be miserable, awkward, and terrible. Remind yourself you\u2019re only there to exchange names, shake a few hands, and hopefully learn some things. Set goals that are attainable, like meeting five new people or getting a chance to explain what you do to three new people. Attend these shindigs with co-workers or bring a friend. You\u2019ll build some confidence, and it\u2019ll be less and less awkward with each event.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Be mindful, too, that you might be picking some lame events to attend. If your target audience is homeowners or real estate agents, you\u2019ll have more opportunities at a local Home Show. If you\u2019ve attended a few networking association meetings and aren\u2019t meeting the right people, stop going. Be smart about how you choose the events you attend. It may just be that you\u2019re attending the wrong get-togethers, not that you\u2019re no good at networking.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Look for ways to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/passion-success-its-a-marriage-not-a-fling\/\"&gt;make networking fun&lt;\/a&gt;. Maybe this summer is the perfect season to host your own networking event. Go out to dinner. Invite colleagues and friends. Do some summer social hour recognizance to find something that sounds appealing to you. And when you attend all these festivities, do so with the intent of making a new acquaintance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to developing new strategic partnerships for your business, make the most of your summer networking opportunities. Consider these tips and suggestions to improve your efforts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And don\u2019t forget, when you want to share some of your success stories in the form of blogs, newsletters, emails, and content, let\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/\"&gt;Ghost Blog Writers&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0help!&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hot.
