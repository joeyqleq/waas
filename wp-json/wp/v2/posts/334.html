I was a little surprised by the findings, but it makes sense.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Business Blogs Looking for Comments&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a bit from article.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article.aspx?R=1008158\"&gt;What Makes for a Compelling Corporate Blog?&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey represented engagement in terms of blog posts that receive comments, so the CMOs polled consider blogs more effective when they produce a lively discussion rather than just pushing content out into the world. The next-most-important characteristic was daily posting; about a quarter of respondents thought it was critical to keep the blog constantly fresh.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CMOs specifically cited Netflix and JetBlue Airways as the companies with the best corporate blogs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comments were the number one attribute companies used for tracking the effectiveness of their blogs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"Comments on Blogs\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Comments-on-Blogs-300x261.jpg\" alt=\"Comments on Blogs\" width=\"300\" height=\"261\" \/&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t surprised to see blogging frequency listed as a big attribute to success for corporate blogs. I was, however,\u00a0surprised\u00a0to see blog commenting up as high as it is. After I thought about it though it makes sense.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Businesses want to engage their target customers and provide value. A comment can serve as an indication of how well you&amp;#8217;re engaging your customers and providing the value they&amp;#8217;re looking for and you&amp;#8217;re trying to provide. It takes effort for people to leave a comment. They have to feel a connection to the community and the blog and feel it is worth their time and effort to add to the discussion.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;#8217;ve noticed in my time as a blogger is the kind of articles that get comments tend to be a bit on the\u00a0controversial\u00a0side. This usually requires the reader to take a side of a topic and stick to their guns. The blog posts with an extremely high number of comments tend to cover topics that have a close to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/femail\/article-1345520\/What-women-REALLY-want-To-marry-rich-man-stay-home-children.html\"&gt;50-50 split on reader opinion&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While controversy seems to cause commenting, I also notice in some instances that passion for a topic can spark engagement. On my own blog &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/countrymusiclife.com\/christian-kane-house-rules\/\"&gt;Country Music Life the most commented on post&lt;\/a&gt; was about a relatively unknown country music artist. The reason I think the post received comments was because the artist typically didn&amp;#8217;t get much press and his hardcore fans were simply excited about the mention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Something else that seems to spark comments is a\u00a0revelation\u00a0of sorts or something amazing. Just today I read a blog post that was actually written some time ago. The post was about a guy that tried &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/freetheanimal.com\/2009\/12\/paleo-i-dont-care-i-like-no-soap-no-shampoo.html\"&gt;soap free bathing&lt;\/a&gt;. The results worked for him. You can tell by the comments people were genuinely intrigued by this experiment. Some doubted the results and others jumped into the experiment themselves. A revelation leading to over 300 comments.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To recap&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;3 Ways to Generate Comments&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Controversy&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Play to the passion of readers&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Share revelation&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: Businesses Need to Blog&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The eMarketer article contained another interesting graphic. Businesses surveyed feel they need a corporate blog to simply keep up with the competition. Customers are learning to expect a blog and companies realize it&amp;#8217;s a cost of doing business these days.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"Reason for Blogging\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Reason-for-Blogging-300x260.jpg\" alt=\"Reason for Blogging\" width=\"300\" height=\"260\" \/&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;A recent finding by eMarketer points out what businesses are looking for regarding their corporate blog.
