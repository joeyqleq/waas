We all know who they are. They aren&amp;#8217;t going to change. That&amp;#8217;s fine. We don&amp;#8217;t have to necessarily spend time with them. Not in our personal lives and hopefully not in our working lives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You probably want to be a happy person and a happy manager. Someone that your team looks forward to seeing every day. It doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that you have to be happy about every little thing. But it does mean looking for the good in what your team does. And looking for solutions versus fixating on problems.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thoughts for being a happy manager.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Balance&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work and life balance is different for everyone. But most of us do need a balance. It&amp;#8217;s an odd source of inspiration, but something that sticks with me about life comes from Rod Stewart&amp;#8217;s autobiography. He said that his father told him that a balanced life involves one vocation, one hobby and one sport. That&amp;#8217;s a pretty good rule of thumb.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would add that family is a key leg in the equation. The more we spread ourselves out the more unbalanced we become. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling unhappy and burned out. Look at what you&amp;#8217;re able to do outside of work to alleviate stress. Maybe you can also delegate some things at work.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Focus On The Positive&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are likely lots of positive things going on at work. Things that you&amp;#8217;re doing. Things your coworkers are doing. Focusing on them brings happiness to the environment. It doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that you ignore the negative. It means that you don&amp;#8217;t only focus on the negative.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Ghost Blog Writers we seem to work in a field where it&amp;#8217;s easy to focus on the negative. We write a post. It&amp;#8217;s 99% wonderful. Just one or two small changes to make. That&amp;#8217;s innocent enough, but do that 100+ times and it can feel like you&amp;#8217;re not doing a good job. So it&amp;#8217;s important to also communicate with our team the great work they&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Identify Team Member Strengths&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes managers get a formula into their head. They try to force their team to fit that formula. That can work. But sometimes it leads to negativity. The person may not be the right fit. That can frustrate them. And it can frustrate the manager because they&amp;#8217;re not getting the performance they want.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s the manager&amp;#8217;s job to get each person in a position to succeed. Obviously to a point where it&amp;#8217;s following how the business operates. But you still want to identify the strengths of each person and determine how they fit into your company. Lean on their strengths. People want to do what they&amp;#8217;re good at.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Express Gratitude To Team Members&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let your team know that you appreciate them. Over-communicate your gratitude. Do it to the point where they get a little tired of hearing it. It&amp;#8217;s better than being silent and focusing on the negative. Or what they&amp;#8217;re doing wrong. We all do things that are wrong or incorrect from time to time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s good to know that we&amp;#8217;re appreciated. It&amp;#8217;s good to know that little things are being noticed. Specific things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Foster Team Connections&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Connection brings happiness in humans. A few of us prefer to be alone most of the time. But the majority crave connection. And work can foster connection. We spend a lot of time with those we work with.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Look for ways to foster connection amongst your team. Projects. Outside activities. All kinds of things that get people working and playing together. Talking. Communicating. Learning about one another.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of our most important relationships in life often come from those we work with.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;6. Limit Notifications&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These days it&amp;#8217;s easy to notify anybody at any time. And even without realizing it we kind of expect the other person to respond instantly. We &lt;em&gt;know&lt;\/em&gt; they have their phone nearby.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Look to limit the notifications you require of your team. And also of yourself. It&amp;#8217;s not a spot of pride to be available all the time. Set the appropriate standard for yourself. Your team will follow. You can accomplish just as much and likely more when you&amp;#8217;re not responding instantly to every message. That cuts into the flow of regular work.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;7. Assess Priority Lists&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also easy to ask a team member to do something. Just one thing. You add to their list. Over time the little things can add up. It can cause confusion on what is most important.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start by focusing on your priority list. You may even be giving yourself little things to do that detract from your true priority list. Cut things out that aren&amp;#8217;t necessary. Then do the same for your team. And when something comes up take the time to consider priority lists. To consider who is the best person for the job including if they have the capacity for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being a happy manager is a good goal. Who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be happy at work? There are lots of reasons you can fall into a negativity trap at work. It often requires intention to want to be positive and happy. But the benefits are many. You will likely be more productive. And your team will very likely be more productive. As well as wanting to come to work more than before.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be happy?
