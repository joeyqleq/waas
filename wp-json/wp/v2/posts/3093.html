Many make it seem like there are silver bullets and quick fixes for getting more traffic, leads and sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are some folks out there that feel blogging can be a silver bullet for online marketing. If you&amp;#8217;ve read through this website and have thought that at any time I apologize. That is not the intent on the content on this site.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The intent is to provide information for how business blogging works, how it can work for you and what the proper expectations are for your business blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogging is not a silver bullet solution. It&amp;#8217;s not quick tip. It&amp;#8217;s not a secret online marketing trick.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Business Blogging For Traffic, Leads and Sales&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a growing segment of the business world that is accepting business blogging as a real marketing business model. Companies like &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.seomoz.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;SEOmoz&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.kissmetrics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;KISSmetrics&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.crazyegg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Crazy Egg&lt;\/a&gt; and others &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/business-blogging-effectiveness\"&gt;are using blogging&lt;\/a&gt;, guides and other forms of content throughout the sales process to get new customers. For these companies, business blogging is a way to grow.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can read about these success stories in business publications. Marketers have been reading the stories so business blogging really isn&amp;#8217;t a secret anymore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Business Blogging Is Not A Quick Tip&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are some posts around &amp;#8211; including a few of my own probably &amp;#8211; that mention blogging as an online marketing tip. You&amp;#8217;ve probably read a few lists out there that have blogging as an item for businesses to do if they want to do online marketing the right way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#8217;s true that blogging is good for online marketing it really isn&amp;#8217;t a quick tip. In fact, there is nothing quick about blogging. It&amp;#8217;s a long-term strategy so it&amp;#8217;s important to put the expectations in the right place from the beginning of your blogging efforts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s why you see so many dormant blogs out there. Their owners get excited about blogging. They write a few posts. Then they run out of ideas or they realize blogging is more work than they originally thought and on top of it all they realize that traffic doesn&amp;#8217;t instantly appear on your site.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is it can take six months to get traction with your blog. That&amp;#8217;s how long it took for &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/sarah-lynn-design-traffic-increase\"&gt;Sarah Lynn Design&lt;\/a&gt;. Even that is pretty unusual. It can take more like 12-18 months to really start getting the traffic you want.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The blog on GBW accounts for a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/blog-analytics\"&gt;53% increase in traffic&lt;\/a&gt; on the site, but it&amp;#8217;s taken years of blogging daily in a really niche market to get to that point.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;No Silver Bullets&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are no silver bullets with blogging. In fact, there are no silver bullets in online marketing, offline marketing or in business. Even things like software and apps aren&amp;#8217;t really silver bullets for your business. There is nothing that will replace hard work combined with a long-term approach.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how you have to approach business blogging. It&amp;#8217;s how we approach it with every client by using the same process:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discuss the Company, Industry and Customer&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Create a Blogging Strategy&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Provide Titles and a Schedule&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Deliver Risk-Free First Post on a Trial Basis&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Ask for Feedback on First Post&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Follow Ongoing Post Schedule&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a long-term strategy that works for our business blog and the blogs of our clients.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stop looking for a silver bullet in online marketing. It&amp;#8217;s the wrong approach to getting more traffic, leads and sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a silver bullet that will bring instant success to your business?
