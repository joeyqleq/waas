Having a balanced perspective on the matter ensures that you\u2019re taking on the right actions to grow your project, venture, or business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the pros and cons of blogging or publishing daily.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Pros of Publishing Daily&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether publishing daily will solve all your money problems is for you to decide. Realistically speaking, what follows are the main upsides to publishing daily.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Content Drives Traffic&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Daily blog posts and articles give your audience a reason to visit your website more frequently. And if the quality of your content is consistently high, they may even add you to their bookmarks or \u201cregular reading\u201d list.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogging is a good way to grow your email list and drive more sales over the long haul.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Content Builds Credibility&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re publishing daily, you should never encounter a situation where visitors come to your website only to find your last post was published in 2015. That can harm your reputation rather than help it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can establish credibility with your audience without publishing daily, but a regular publishing schedule can make a difference. People love to see an active company, even one that\u2019s just keeping up the appearance of being busy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Content Generates Opportunity&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogging daily will inevitably attract new opportunities, customers, and clients. If you show up and do the work, people will take notice. While you can\u2019t always control the types of opportunities that come your way, low-hanging fruit will be largely yours to claim, especially if no one else in your industry is blogging daily.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Cons of Blogging Daily&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are certain challenges to blogging daily. Here are the main ones you should be aware of.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Generating Ideas can be a Slog&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many writers, marketers, and entrepreneurs begin the process of blogging daily with an elevated sense of excitement. Then they get a few days in only to notice the blank page staring back at them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some writers don\u2019t have this problem, but it\u2019s rare. As a daily blogger, you\u2019ve got to be willing to capture all ideas that come to you and take note of all relevant comments and questions your audience leaves on your posts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;It Takes Time &amp;amp; Effort&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren\u2019t the one doing all the writing, you may need to take on the role of editing, formatting, and scheduling posts, which takes more time and effort than you might think.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Publishing daily is a commitment, and it needs to be taken seriously.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;It Can be Difficult to Maintain Consistent Quality&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/seths.blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Seth Godin&lt;\/a&gt; is an excellent example of someone who publishes daily. His content is well-loved, but even he probably wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s brilliant seven days per week.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you can dedicate all your time to publishing daily, you may not struggle with maintaining the quality of blog posts or articles. But if you have other tasks you\u2019ve been saddled with, it\u2019s a much tougher job to follow through on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re going to publish daily, my recommendation would be to tie it back to strategy. Set goals. Clarify what you want to accomplish. Ensure that the content you\u2019re producing is relevant. And since a lot of time and effort will be going into your content, look for every opportunity to repurpose your content assets.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;There are marketers out there making bold claims about publishing daily.
