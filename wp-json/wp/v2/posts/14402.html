You\u2019re posting regularly. You\u2019re \u201cliking\u201d and \u201csharing\u201d content. You might even be dabbling with TikTok videos. But if it\u2019s not generating leads for your business, what\u2019s it doing?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More importantly, business leaders should think about what they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;\/em&gt; their social media to do for their bottom line. Branding is necessary but harder to measure than marketing. Marketing is measurable but doesn\u2019t always result in sales. And the yardsticks you use to measure all your efforts can be deceiving.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, what social media strategies actually work in today\u2019s market for driving sales? And which techniques and trends aren\u2019t going to generate bottom-line results?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keep reading. We\u2019ll shed some valuable social media strategy light on what works and what doesn\u2019t.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right Social Channels and Strategies&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before you make any changes to your current strategy, take a look at what social channels you&amp;#8217;re using. There are slews of options, and you may be tempted to try and represent your business&lt;img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-14403 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/adem-ay-Tk9m_HP4rgQ-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Free Photo by Adem AY on Unsplash\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/adem-ay-Tk9m_HP4rgQ-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/adem-ay-Tk9m_HP4rgQ-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/adem-ay-Tk9m_HP4rgQ-unsplash-1.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/&gt; across all of them. But you don&amp;#8217;t have to use them all. And you don&amp;#8217;t want to try and manage five social pages and profiles when you can achieve the same results and more with two.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to determine which social media channels your business should be using, consider your ideal customer. Use your buyer personas to help you determine what your core audience looks like, how they behave, and what they prefer. You can then decide which social media channels &lt;em&gt;they&lt;\/em&gt; use most to make purchasing decisions and communicate. Those are the social platforms you should focus on using and leveraging. And when you can precisely select the social media tools that speak to your best audience, you can then begin to carve out strategies for each that, upon execution, drive results.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The \u2018What Do You Think\u2019 Strategy&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter what social media platform you\u2019re using, from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok and LinkedIn; when you ask your audience what they think, people will respond. When you\u2019re able to scratch a topic that resonates with people, they\u2019re going to tell you what they think. And it\u2019s a great strategy to incorporate into your social marketing plans.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/proven-social-media-engagement-strategies\"&gt;HubSpot suggests&lt;\/a&gt; as examples of the \u201cwhat do you think\u201d strategy:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask for an opinion on something, probing their personalities.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Play the irresistible \u201ctest your knowledge\u201d type of game with your posts.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Publish a poll or a survey about something easy yet meaningful.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just ask whatever questions seem fun, relevant, and engaging.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Get Your Social Media Audience Talking About You&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another social media marketing strategy that works well across all channels involves encouraging your audience to talk &lt;em&gt;about&lt;\/em&gt; you. In addition to the aforementioned methods of talking &lt;em&gt;with&lt;\/em&gt; you, look to post content that inspires your audience to share your posts or media with others in their circles. When you get people buzzing about your brand, you can gain some viral traction with your posts. Here are a few examples of this:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hashtags connect like-minded people and trending conversations. Use them!&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use social media contests or queries that prompt your audience to upload pics or videos.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rally up some reviews by sharing and asking others to share positive engagements.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post employee or customer spotlights, promoting great experiences.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Company announcements, new products\/services, and news are always shareable.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Incentives, Competitions, and Gamification Work&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get your brand rally going on social media, tap into games. People love to play games, and they especially love to win things. You can use that to your advantage by creating trivia or contests. And with each winner, even the smallest rewards can give you brand mileage with additional shares, likes, and retweets. Additionally, some of the best contests are those that involve giving back to the community or supporting a local charity. So, get your audience involved and give back, all while promoting your business. It\u2019s a win, win, win!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Social Media Is Perfect for Special Offers&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t over-stimulate your social media channels. Your clients will burn out from too many games, and incentives can lose their luster if you saturate with them. So, add another type of post to your social strategy specifically to promote special offers. These are short, vibrant posts that ask your audience to do something, usually clicking a link or buying. Here are some offers that make for great social media content:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Instant discounts or coupons&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seasonal or holiday-related promotions&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Memberships or subscription deals&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free shipping or value-adds&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s the other thing. Try not to promote the same special too often. A &amp;#8220;special&amp;#8221; that happens all the time no longer remains &amp;#8220;special.&amp;#8221; Change things up and experiment with various perks and deals to see which generates more social media engagement. Remember to follow these tips when creating your offers, too:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make your discounts valuable (free or 20% off are great)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose an engaging image or video asset to go with your offer&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Put a timeframe on your offer (FOMO)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Social Media as a Lead Magnet&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you dangle the carrot, you can lead the horse to water without force. The same principle applies to your prospects on social media. You don\u2019t have to come at them with a hard-sale offer. And while you can get conversions on social, these platforms are better used as lead magnets. Promote content that sparks attention, inspires interest, and moves potential prospects further down your sales funnel.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of direct conversion efforts, use your social media as a channel for dangling carrots that lead your prospects to take one step closer to a sale. Making your engagements useful to them, for example, with a guide or a free tool or valuable information, they\u2019ll consume it. And they\u2019ll be positioned in a more favorable decision to take the next step, which might be signing up for your newsletter. From there, they&amp;#8217;re two steps closer to becoming a customer and buying.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The top two reasons anyone will ever take the carrot are:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re educating them&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re authentically engaging them&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, use other marketing tools in your arsenal, including blog posts, videos, tutorials, behind-the-scenes, infographics, webinars, and downloadable assets on your social media channels as valuable content. And then track the metrics for these lead magnets to see which are more effective at engaging and moving prospects further toward purchasing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Social Media Mistakes to Avoid (These Are NOT Working for Your Business)&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some fresh ideas for what you should be doing with social media, it\u2019s important to address some of the social mistakes you might be making. There are obvious mistakes, like posting with poor grammar, sharing overly-politicized content, or losing your cool in a post. However, you can also make yourself a \u201cnot to do\u201d list, including these other mistakes, to use as a guide before you implement any new strategies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Being Post-Happy Isn\u2019t Going to Cut It&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being an aggressive poster on &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.moengage.com\/blog\/7-social-media-marketing-mistakes-to-avoid\/\"&gt;social media&lt;\/a&gt; isn\u2019t going to make you land clients faster. And always talking about your business isn\u2019t going to cut it either. In fact, it can drive the opposite effect. So, find a consistent frequency you can stick to and make every post in your schedule count. And remember to incorporate content that is relevant to them, not just your brand or offer. Once per day works effectively for LinkedIn. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/how-to-grow-on-twitter-in-2023-beyond\/\"&gt;With Twitter&lt;\/a&gt;, you can do two to five tweets daily. Facebook can be daily, with no more than three posts every day. And Instagram is just fine with a weekly posting schedule. Whatever you decide, channel or frequency-wise, stick to it. And as long as you keep the content dynamic, interesting, and varied, you can increase frequency as you see fit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Trying to Sell to Everyone&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, your social media channels are intended to connect your brand to your target audience. And while everyone\u2019s on social media these days, not everyone is going to be in your wheelhouse. Don\u2019t put lofty expectations of results on social, especially through the lens of trying to sell to everyone. Not everyone out there scrolling is going to be interested in what your brand has to offer, say, or sell. Be specific about defining the targets for each social platform you use. And when you do engage, speak to those captive personas about their unique problems. You can use your content to educate, convince, and convert those within those buyers\u2019 markets. For example, if your business sells windows, you aren&amp;#8217;t going to win any sales among people who rent. In this instance, all your posts should address and cater to homeowners.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Ignoring Conversations or Mentions&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another mistake you might be making is avoidance. When you do finally connect with your audience, and they take the time to mention your brand or connect with you directly, you should respond. That\u2019s the point of engagement \u2013 engaging. Make sure you have a process in place, whether it\u2019s you or someone on your marketing team, to manage responses to questions, tags, and mentions. If you ignore your comments, you\u2019ll be setting the expectation with them and everyone else watching that you don\u2019t care enough to respond.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Negative comments deserve attention, too. Ignoring them will only hurt your brand. Responding unprofessionally will only hurt your brand even worse. Consider creating a response plan for how you will respond to critical remarks or disparaging comments. Keep it light, polite, and friendly every time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monitor your threads, too. What you start as an innocent or benign post could get derailed if others begin bickering amongst each other. Have moderators keep an eye out for unsavory directions your people might take the conversation. Bad publicity on your post or page, even if it\u2019s not you, can make your company look bad.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Automating Too Much&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Automation is amazing for business, especially when it comes to posting and managing your social strategies. But, like with anything, too much of a good thing can be bad. And if you\u2019re relying on automation or AI too much, your audience will sense it and disconnect. There still needs to be a personalization element to your engagement strategy. There needs to be thought before you can offer thought leadership. And finding that healthy balance between automation and customization that will allow your social media results to be great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Treating All Your Social Media Channels the Same&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each social media platform has its own superpower of engagement. You\u2019ll be making a mistake if you\u2019re posting the same exact content on all your platforms all the time. Learn the \u201clanguage\u201d and purpose of each platform you\u2019re using so you can maximize its reach and engagement superpower.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here\u2019s a helpful breakdown:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook: Great for engaging conversation and rolling out updates.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cI like cheese.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitter: Great for news and customer-facing questions. The fastest outlet for real-time engagement.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cI\u2019m eating cheese right now.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pinterest: The third largest networking social site, perfect for spreading visual assets and content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cSee how beautifully arranged my cheese is.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn: Great for networking in a more professional arena. Discuss trends and promote thought-leadership content here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cMy skills include quality cheese-eating.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube: Great for tutorials, behind-the-scenes, and FAQ video engagement.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cWatch me make, present, and eat cheese.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instagram: Photo and video dominant, great for engaging visual content conversions and brand awareness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cLook at my cheese.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;TikTok: Get in on the latest trends using hashtags and authentically created video content that supports your image.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cI\u2019m going to party over here, eating my cheese that\u2019s bringing me joy.\u201d&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because every business is different, every social media marketing plan will be different. However, if you\u2019re able to tap into these few strategies that work well, along with avoiding the common mistakes that don\u2019t work, you can set yourself up for engagement success.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, whenever you need brilliant content for any of your social media platforms, the team of wordsmiths at &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/\"&gt;Ghost Blog Writers&lt;\/a&gt; is standing by, ready to create messaging that resonates!
