I&amp;#8217;m sure that&amp;#8217;s true. My eyes can go a little wonky after reading on that small screen for a few hours.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it does get annoying to continually swipe to turn hundreds of pages.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the phone has worked pretty well for me over the years.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Back To The Library&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But last week my wife and I went to the local library.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was an idea she had been working on for some time. She&amp;#8217;d mentioned that she wanted to go and finally she made the commitment and I went along.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We walked in and signed up for our cars. That process only took a few minutes. Then we were on our way into the heart of the building where all the books were.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A Huge Selection Of Books&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we started walking around the library with all the books I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe it. I don&amp;#8217;t know why I was surprised because the point of a library is to see a lot of books.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife had a few books she wanted to check out first so we went to that section and found the books.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After that we started browsing the non-fiction area and we went our separate ways for a few minutes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I met back up with my wife she had a handful of books and I teased her a bit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the same thing had happened to me. There were a ton of books that I wanted to checkout.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I felt like a kid looking at all the information that was there just waiting to be consumed. I felt that urge to learn and to build wisdom and learn about things I&amp;#8217;m interested in, but not well versed in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up selecting just one book. I thought I should pace myself to read one book at a time. I&amp;#8217;ll read it and then take it back.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits Of The Library&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So at the moment I&amp;#8217;m reading one book on my phone, one on our Kindle and one physical book. All three are golf books.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m about midway through the one I got from the library. I had been reading it pretty solidly for a few days, but then got back into the book on the Kindle.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My plan now is to read through all three and especially the ones on the devices. I want to get through those so I can focus only on library books.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The obvious benefit of the library is the price: FREE!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe it and I should have known that fact.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll be nice not having to spend $10-$15 on books anymore. I probably still will. The selection was pretty impressive to me with the number of books our local library had including some hard-to-find classics and some new books.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a little cash, maybe $15\/mo, that I spend on books, but that will be nice.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thanks To My Wife&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife brings a lot of good to my life and this is another example. I don&amp;#8217;t think I would have ever thought to go back to the library without her. Now I think I might get hooked. We both might get hooked.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s one more thing we can share together.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next up is setting aside time for reading each day. It&amp;#8217;s obviously easier if the books you&amp;#8217;re reading are interesting. But with only so many hours in the day it probably means cutting out some other things and for me that&amp;#8217;s probably TV. I don&amp;#8217;t think I watch a ton right now, but maybe even cutting out TV all together.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;ll be that much of a challenge especially with the thought of gathering great knowledge from all the books in the library.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Last week my wife wanted to go to our local library.
