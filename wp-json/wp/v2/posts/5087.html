That leads to good scoring and smiles.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a professional golfer, but I am pretty good at it some days. On this day things were going well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I hit a great shot on the last hole only to see it hit something on the edge of the fairway that shot it way out into the rough.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That something turned out to be a sprinkler.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A sprinkler. They&amp;#8217;re on every golf course, but they&amp;#8217;re the size of a small Frisbee. What are the chances of hitting a sprinkler with a drive? Not very good.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But on this day the golf gods decided it was time for me to hit a sprinkler.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe my luck. I thought about the bad luck as I prepared to hit the next shot and that shot didn&amp;#8217;t turn out very good. I think I made a double bogey and there went the good round.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Bad Breaks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re going to get bad breaks in life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They might happen while you&amp;#8217;re on the job. Maybe you lose a big prospective client because there was one thing they liked about the competition that you didn&amp;#8217;t have at that moment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you planned some great marketing campaigns for the new year only to see Facebook and Twitter change their rules on how you can promote to your followers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that can go wrong in life. It&amp;#8217;s not fair, but in the end, that&amp;#8217;s how life works.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Good Breaks Vs. Bad Breaks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In golf I&amp;#8217;ve found there are times when I get some really bad breaks. I hit great shots only to see them end up in horrible locations. That&amp;#8217;s the example above.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But there are other times when I hit really bad shots (I&amp;#8217;m talking really bad) and the ball ends up in a great location; sometimes even in the hole.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the past I&amp;#8217;ve kind of focused on the bad breaks more. I would make a stink about the bad breaks as if someone was going to care.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But when good breaks would happen I&amp;#8217;d kind of brush it off. I would think that maybe I was owed that good break for some reason.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But now what I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that good and bad breaks are just part of golf.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#8217;re part of life as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can control only a few things in life and one of them is how you respond to the breaks you get.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Keeping The Right Attitude&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These days when I&amp;#8217;m on the course I try to keep a positive attitude as much as I can. I practice and when I go to the course I trust my practice. I try to be confident in every shot. When bad breaks happen I shake it off as part of the game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I do the same when good breaks happen. I try to keep it on the level and assess how my game is in spite of the good and bad breaks I&amp;#8217;m getting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think in life you&amp;#8217;re going to find that you&amp;#8217;ll get an equal amount of good and bad breaks. It might not seem that way, but you have control over your perception of the breaks you get in life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you focus on the positive breaks you&amp;#8217;ll find that you&amp;#8217;re a pretty lucky person and that you&amp;#8217;re good at what you do. That can lead to self-encouragement and from there you can accomplish great things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And even if that doesn&amp;#8217;t work out all the way at least you&amp;#8217;ll be happier every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worked for me on the course and I&amp;#8217;m trying to do it in life and in business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So far so good.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Do bad things seem to happen to you more than they do to others?
