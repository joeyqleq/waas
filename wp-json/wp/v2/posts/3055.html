Here is how to avoid that fate. via &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mourner\/150844753\/\"&gt;Flickr&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/figcaption&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this line of work you come across ambitious people all the time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to starting blogs people always seem ambitious. There are always big plans to start a blog whether for business or personal reasons, but after a few initial posts things calm down. The blogger loses interest and now you have another\u00a0abandoned\u00a0blog out there on the Internet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogger disinterest happens with personal blogs and it happens with business blogs. You could think that business bloggers would have a little more incentive to write, but it&amp;#8217;s not really the case.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re wondering why your employees won&amp;#8217;t blog here are the main reasons I&amp;#8217;ve seen. And to help you out I&amp;#8217;ve included some ways to get the most out of your future bloggers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Reason #1: No Understanding of Blogging&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When people don&amp;#8217;t have knowledge of something they tend to back off. If you expect your employees, even those that work in an Internet department, to understand blogging you&amp;#8217;re fighting a difficult battle to get them to blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Few people have the urge to start blogging on their own. Even fewer have the urge to keep blogging for the long-term beyond the initial excitement phase.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means you&amp;#8217;ll have to help build the blogging expertise of those you want to blog. It&amp;#8217;s good if they have interest at first, but if you send them to a blogging class or a blogging conference they&amp;#8217;ll come back with a better understanding.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once they have that they&amp;#8217;re more likely to blog and combined with the next two areas you can implement a long-term blogging plan.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Reason #2: No Support or Feedback&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Something that happens within companies is that when there isn&amp;#8217;t an understanding of something people push back against it. This happens with those that aren&amp;#8217;t involved in blogging. They don&amp;#8217;t understand it and they wonder why the company is supporting such a venture.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s up to the executive team to get buy-in from all in the company. This will create a support system within the company so the bloggers on the team feel like they have support from the executive team and their peers within the company as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also an issue for the bloggers not to get feedback. Bloggers can follow the plan and make adjustments based on what they&amp;#8217;re seeing, but it&amp;#8217;s important to get feedback so they can improve and make changes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your company doesn&amp;#8217;t have the right people on the team to provide good feedback then bring in someone from outside to look at the blogging strategy. Find a trusted partner or colleague with experience in blogging and just have them provide some feedback. Have them share what they like and what they think could be altered.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This usually revives interest in the blog and gives additional direction to the writers on your team, which they need.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Reason #3: Wrong Expectations&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest reason I see that blogs are abandoned.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of discussion about how great blogging is, but the truth is that it&amp;#8217;s usually more work and a longer timeframe for payoff than most think. These wrong expectations set you up for failure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases you won&amp;#8217;t get much traffic or any interaction at all on your blog for months or even years.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll tell you that a business blog that posts once a week will not see much results for at least six months and probably more like a year. If you can do more frequency you might get response sooner.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s just like when you started your business. It takes time to build an audience. It takes time to build connections.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But over time you get a good word of mouth going and it kind of snowballs from there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Talk to people you know that have had business blogs for a few years. Ask them about their blogging timelines and you&amp;#8217;ll get a better picture of what your blog will look like.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then setup the plan with a series of small milestones. This will keep your staff on track with the right expectations. They won&amp;#8217;t get frustrated when the traffic doesn&amp;#8217;t fly in on the first post.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bloggers will often give the reason of &amp;#8220;not having enough time&amp;#8221; as the biggest reason for not blogging, but in my experience it&amp;#8217;s all about expectations, communication and understanding. When you have those in line from the start you&amp;#8217;ll give your business blog a much better chance of succeeding.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Set things up right with a plan that includes expected results. Also give your bloggers credit when they do great things. If they write a great post make sure to acknowledge it because it might not get notice outside of the company right away. Keep them encouraged and it&amp;#8217;ll help keep the content coming.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult things for a business today is getting people to blog.
