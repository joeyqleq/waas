Energy levels deplete, decision making capacity becomes stunted, and your senses dull. So, even menial tasks can appear big tasks and elevate stress levels.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it\u2019s just a quick refresh, you need a few ways to recharge and maintain your energy through the day. Here\u2019s how.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Create&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spend some time drawing, painting, or crafting. Art is engrossing and it can take your mind off work, even if it\u2019s only for a few brief minutes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you don\u2019t feel creatively inclined, or don\u2019t have any intention of creating anything yourself, then at least hang artwork in your workplace. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.workdesign.com\/2016\/10\/art-workplace-need-choose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Work Design Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;\u2019s Rachel Smith says viewing artwork can restore mental energy, reduce stress, and even boost brain performance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Meditate&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The benefits of meditation are too numerous to mention. From reducing stress to improving sleep quality, you\u2019ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;15 to 20 minutes of quiet meditation in the morning or even in the afternoon can offer the quick refresh you need to carry on with your workday at peak efficiency.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beware of overcomplicating the process though. You don\u2019t need a special meditation room, meditation chair, incense, candles, and a sleep mask to \u201cdo it right.\u201d Simply find a quiet space, put on some music, close your eyes, and breathe.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In an article on &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/benefits-of-reading-books#reduces-stress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Healthline&lt;\/a&gt;, Joy Stanborough, MFA says 30 minutes of reading can lower your blood pressure, heart rate, and even feelings of psychological distress.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reading can also prepare you for a better night\u2019s rest, alleviate symptoms of depression, help you live longer, and more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Busy people sometimes forget to schedule in exercise or simply can\u2019t seem to find the time for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we all know that &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/theheartfoundation.org\/2019\/08\/10\/is-sitting-the-new-smoking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;sitting is the new smoking&lt;\/a&gt;. There are altogether too many health risks associated with sitting for long hours for it to be worth the trouble long term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it\u2019s just getting up and going to the washroom, making tea, or taking a walk around the block, the effort you put into exercise will pay off in spades.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you can, though, try to fit in a 15 minute high intensity interval training workout three times per week. Even the busiest of professionals should be able to manage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Nap&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tired or sleepy? Feeling dull? Exhausted and ineffective?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For productivity fiends, sleeping can sometimes feel like a waste of time. Yet, it might be the exact midday boost you need to perform at a high level during the final hours of the day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you haven\u2019t had enough sleep, the slightest of problems can seem insurmountable. But after you\u2019ve gotten some rest, the challenges may not seem so monumental after all.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It may seem as though taking time to recharge would only take away from your productive hours. But it\u2019s the opposite. As you begin to form a routine around self-care and exercise, you\u2019ll find yourself better able to concentrate and get things done, all without feeling drained at the end of the day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What changes will you be making to your routine?&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Whether you\u2019re a 60-hour per week entrepreneur or a busy freelancer with a full schedule, working long, hard hours is sometimes par for the course.
