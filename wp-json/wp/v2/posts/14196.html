If you\u2019re satisfied with the results, then there may not be an urgent need to add paid ads to your marketing mix.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Don\u2019t forget, though, that if your current marketing is successful, and you want to amplify it, paid ads are generally the fastest and easiest way to scale).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if it seems like you\u2019ve tried every free channel available, and you\u2019re still not generating traffic, leads, or sales, it may be time to consider paid ads a little more seriously.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where SEO and content can take six to 12 months to work, it\u2019s also contingent on whether:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You did your keyword research&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your content is best in its class&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your content speaks to your audience&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, paid ads are like a \u201ctap\u201d you can turn on and off at will. Traffic is basically instantaneous, and the only limiting factor is your budget.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Do You Have Ideas You Need to Test?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plenty of entrepreneurs and companies start out creating a new product for their audience. Sometimes it\u2019s based on spontaneous inspiration or \u201chunch\u201d of what might work, and at other times it\u2019s based on something more concrete like &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/what-your-customers-wished-you-knew-about-how-to-engage-them\/\"&gt;audience&lt;\/a&gt; surveying and research.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But even if you think you know all the variables and understand your audience well, nailing a sales message can be challenging.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on your audience, \u201cNew Business Newsletter\u201d might be a \u201csafe\u201d and effective headline, while for other audiences, something classic like \u201cHow to do X in 90 Days Without Y\u2026\u201d might be more in keeping with the expectation of solving their pains.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With paid ads, you can run multiple iterations simultaneously with different headlines (while pointing to the same destination) to test which headlines resonate best with your audience. This would be a wise step to take before disseminating your offer more broadly, through email campaigns, social media, affiliates, and so on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Every Situation is Different&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to target audience, market conditions, and even branding, there are different channels and methodologies that are bound to work best for your audience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you understand your customer profile well, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already nailed your messaging and marketing message to be able to generate steady, consistent results.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even then, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you don\u2019t need to use ads, especially if you want to grow and scale.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While you don\u2019t need to use ads for everything, it would be to your advantage to use them for testing, to determine your best headlines, call to actions, offers, and so forth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, every situation is different. Some businesses can grow organically by repeating the same processes. Others may require more eyes on their offers to be able to build a sustainable business. Many businesses, however, will end up using a mixed approach, using both organic and paid channels to generate real marketing results.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;To make money, you\u2019ve got to spend money.
