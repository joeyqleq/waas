I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to hone my skills at being focused on the single thing I&amp;#8217;m doing when I&amp;#8217;m doing it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to have the mindset that multitasking as the best thing to do for productivity. But more on this later.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some entrepreneurs hacks for staying focused and productive. It&amp;#8217;s more important for entrepreneurs because there are a ton of tasks you have and that can get overwhelming.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found that the following hacks can help to make it seem like you have way more time than you used to. I think they can help you too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Kill Multi-Tasking, Embrace Single-Tasking&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest one that has worked for me. As I mentioned earlier, I used to try to be the multi-tasking king. I thought it was a badge of honor to do everything at once.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that I wasn&amp;#8217;t getting things done and the work I was doing was not good.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I try to have a laser-like focus while working on something. If I&amp;#8217;m writing a post, i&amp;#8217;m only writing a post. If I&amp;#8217;m working on emails, I&amp;#8217;m only working on emails.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it extends to other areas of my life. If I&amp;#8217;m driving, I&amp;#8217;m driving. If I&amp;#8217;m talking to my wife, I&amp;#8217;m talking to my wife. The same with dinner and all other things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It can be an adjustment for you and for those around you, but once you&amp;#8217;re used to it (and they&amp;#8217;re used to it) you&amp;#8217;ll notice the results. The quality of your time improves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Start With A Big Picture View&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re working in your business\u00a0it&amp;#8217;s usually all you can do to get to the next day. There are so many little tasks and they can consume your day. You&amp;#8217;ll be busy just getting through each day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That process can kill your business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take a step back and look at your company from the big picture view. Start at the &amp;#8220;end&amp;#8221; of your business. Think about where you want to go. It might be $1 billion in revenue or maybe it&amp;#8217;s $200,000\/year in income for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start there and work you way back on what you have to do to get there. You&amp;#8217;ll find that once you have the vision in place it&amp;#8217;s easier to fill in the big and small things you need to do to get there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll work all the way back to your day-to-day work and that&amp;#8217;s when we get to the next step.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Prioritize Daily Tasks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you work all the way back to your daily tasks you&amp;#8217;ll probably realize that you&amp;#8217;re doing some things that just aren&amp;#8217;t necessary.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges as an entrepreneur is that you can only do so many things. You can only do so many online marketing initiatives. I&amp;#8217;d like to think that it would be a business blog, but that&amp;#8217;s not the case for every business. For you, it might be investing in email marketing and online advertising.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For GBW, it&amp;#8217;s blogging, but we really only focus on blogging. It&amp;#8217;s the top priority for us.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this step you&amp;#8217;ll learn that some things are really important and other things aren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Parts of this will be hard. I realized that I didn&amp;#8217;t have time to talk on the phone with clients. Some clients liked this and I liked talking with them, but email was the most efficient and most important for most clients. So I had to cut out calls and stick only with email whenever possible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That freed up lots of time and improved the business too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Work In Short Bursts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This one is kind of unique, but it works for me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It started when I was blogging. I would put in a good 20 minute session of researching or writing. Then I&amp;#8217;d kind of take a breather. I would literally exhale and go read a news article or watch a YouTube video or something. I like checking in on the PGA Tour highlights and videos on YouTube.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That kills about 5 minutes. Then it&amp;#8217;s back for another 20 minute burst with more on the blog post or maybe answering an email that popped in the inbox.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to keep me refreshed. Otherwise I would be working nonstop and would get worn out faster.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5.\u00a0Only Work During Work Hours&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This one was the toughest to do, but it&amp;#8217;s had incredible return. I basically am punched in from about 6 AM to 4 PM. The biggest change was that I don&amp;#8217;t check my work or personal email before 6 AM or after 4 PM anymore. It&amp;#8217;s been incredible. It was really tough, but it has been great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to check email right before bed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All that resulted in was me seeing work emails and then thinking about it. Then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t sleep.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t check your email at night. The work can wait until the morning when you&amp;#8217;re ready to be &amp;#8220;on&amp;#8221; again.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sleep is very important to do this and energize yourself in the off hours. You&amp;#8217;ll do much better work when you&amp;#8217;re refreshed and ready to go. You might have to train your clients with this, but they&amp;#8217;ll live. They&amp;#8217;ve just become used to you being available 24\/7. Let them know about the change. They understand.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These can be difficult to make happen. It&amp;#8217;s like with any routine or habit, you need to push through the challenge of change, but after even a few days you&amp;#8217;ll get used to it. And when you notice the results (more things getting done and a happier you) you&amp;#8217;ll find it&amp;#8217;s easy and you&amp;#8217;ll wonder why you didn&amp;#8217;t make the change sooner!&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Are you working hard and not getting your business to grow?
