There are just so many that I had to cut back to the ones that really give me something to think about.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After analyzing these top business blogs I thought it was interesting that each kind of offer something different. I&amp;#8217;m going to analyze each and see if we can pull something out to learn from them as we try to create our own successful business blogs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/blog\/index.html\"&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This site is great for news about being a business owner. In fact, you just have to be in business to get interesting information on this site. I love the idea of taking the news in an industry and providing perspective. Anybody can report the news (for some reason reporters think it&amp;#8217;s a race to be first), but it takes more skill to analyze the implications for readers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what Entrepreneur does.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Inc.&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/\"&gt;Inc.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inc. has become\u00a0&lt;em&gt;Home Of The Lists&lt;\/em&gt;. The entire site is a big list it seems like, but you know what? People love it. The information seems so basic on the surface, but I find myself going back there. I don&amp;#8217;t get value out of every post, but some are really useful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The great thing about a list is it&amp;#8217;s easy to take action. Entrepreneurs want to take action. That&amp;#8217;s why Inc. gives them lists. The site has found a formula that works and they really hammer it home and it&amp;#8217;s working.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Forbes&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blog: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/home_usa\/\"&gt;Forbes&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t my favorite site, but tons of people visit the site and have read the magazine. They must be doing something right. I think they have a lot of thought provoking articles. The writers seem to have points to prove and that&amp;#8217;s not always a bad thing. When the status quo is challenged it forces all of us to question the way we do things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we challenge ourselves we take things even further and that&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Atlantic&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/\"&gt;The Atlantic Business&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot of Atlantic articles. I hadn&amp;#8217;t even planned on doing it. I just saw articles from the Atlantic all over social media and I thought they were an interesting case to include on this list. The newspaper is not exclusively about business, but they do have a very good business blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know when business became so involved in politics so I avoid those articles, but there are still some great ones on this site. The great thing is they are usually very in depth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t think people read long stories or blog posts?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People read The Atlantic like crazy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Seth Godin&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/sethgodin.typepad.com\/\"&gt;Seth&amp;#8217;s Blog&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin&amp;#8217;s blog was one of the first I started reading back five or six years ago. He has an interesting approach to marketing. He tells stories. He makes things actionable without giving away too much information.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Godin&amp;#8217;s posts are short. He&amp;#8217;s always focusing on his main product, which is the book. He writes much on his blog, but he saves the really meaty material for his books. It&amp;#8217;s a great example of a blog that can drive interest and sales in a product.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: Tease your target readers with really good information and then dazzle them with your product. I like using the example of a plumber here on the GBW Blog. A plumber can easily write about unclogging drains on a business blog. It helps people, but to the plumber it&amp;#8217;s basic information. But with the blog the plumber earns trust and when the bigger projects come along readers hire the blogger than helped them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are many other business blogs and we all have our favorites. I think that&amp;#8217;s the point of blogging. You write for a few people, not everyone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Share your favorite blogs in the comments and let&amp;#8217;s continue the discussion about top business blogs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#8217;re taking a look at the top business blogs about business.
