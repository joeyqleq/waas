They&amp;#8217;re busy all the time and out of energy. It seems like they&amp;#8217;re pouring everything into the business without getting anything in return.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a common situation and I&amp;#8217;ve been there with Ghost Blog Writers. In the past, I&amp;#8217;ve worn myself out working endless hours while it seemed like I wasn&amp;#8217;t making any progress on actually growing the business. It&amp;#8217;s frustrating and it can drain your passion for the company. And that&amp;#8217;s really not good because it makes you feel like giving it up.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my best startup productivity tips for startup founders. These tips should actually help you grow more while seemingly doing less.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Set Your Key Business Activities&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest one I&amp;#8217;ve had to learn and I&amp;#8217;m still working on it. When you&amp;#8217;re busy all day, every day and you&amp;#8217;re not getting anywhere it&amp;#8217;s usually the result of working on the wrong things. You might think that what you&amp;#8217;re working on is important, but how important can it be if you&amp;#8217;re not growing?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve learned that getting customers is the only way to grow a business. You can work on your product all day long, but if you&amp;#8217;re not getting anyone to use it then you&amp;#8217;re not going to succeed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was working on client blog posts at GBW. It was an important task, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t the top priority. A top priority was getting customers. So I decided that for the business to grow I would need to delegate that task and focus more on marketing and sales. Now I put more effort into the posts on the GBW Blog, which brings in our inbound leads and I work on closing those leads when they come in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Figure out how you can get new customers and make sure either you or someone else focuses on it every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Delegate All Repeatable Tasks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every task is possible to delegate. For about a year I&amp;#8217;ve been working on setting up repeatable systems for GBW. So far I&amp;#8217;ve been able to delegate all the client work and it&amp;#8217;s been great for the business. It was scary at first, but the business has been able to grow as a result.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;m trying to systemize the marketing and sales processes along with the managing of the business on the accounting side of things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trap for startup founders is to think that you have to do everything in the business. I&amp;#8217;ve fallen into it. Now my mindset is on making it possible for someone else to do all the tasks. I don&amp;#8217;t want to be a necessary requirement for GBW to run effectively. I want to be able to take vacations and know that the business can run and grow without me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start creating processes for every task in your business starting with the ones you don&amp;#8217;t like and the ones that are most important. For me, it was delegating client blog writing. Next it&amp;#8217;s delegating marketing, sales and accounting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Schedule Every Phone Call&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you know me you know that I&amp;#8217;m not a huge fan of the phone. I think it&amp;#8217;s easier to get things done via email, but what I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that I don&amp;#8217;t necessarily hate talking on the phone. What I hate is being interrupted with calls out of the blue. I like to have a plan when I talk on the phone. Being prepared makes the call much more effective.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I like to schedule my days with the highest priority items first each day. If I get a call while I&amp;#8217;m working through my schedule I don&amp;#8217;t answer it. I used to and it drove me nuts. I would struggle to get things done. Now I schedule every call for after noon. If someone calls I&amp;#8217;ll let them leave a message. Then I&amp;#8217;ll email them and provide a few times for the discussion. I&amp;#8217;ll make these times for later in the day so they&amp;#8217;re after I get the top priority items done first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, some businesses will have to put out fires and take phone calls on demand, but this is where you&amp;#8217;ll need to setup a process for someone to handle the task of taking phone calls. If it&amp;#8217;s a priority item then setup a process and make it someone&amp;#8217;s job to handle it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Get On A Proper Diet And Exercise Plan&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These last two are a little different than you&amp;#8217;ve probably read on other posts, but I think they&amp;#8217;re extremely important. The first is diet and exercise. Yes, we all know that diet and exercise are good, but it seems that &amp;#8220;busy&amp;#8221; startup owners are really bad with their diet and exercise. They each &amp;#8220;easy&amp;#8221; junk food and sit in their chair all day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t want to fall into this so I make sure to take walks 4-5 days a week when possible. I take the stairs. I also do high intensity workouts (&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zy7j9FRiJpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;video&lt;\/a&gt;) 2 times each week along with basic weight training (push-ups, planks, etc.).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t take much. The intensity workouts and weight training takes one hour\u00a0&lt;em&gt;a week&lt;\/em&gt;. The walking can be done in 20, 30 or 60 minutes each time depending and walking is a great way to think about your business&amp;#8217;s big picture. You can put the walking on auto-pilot and think about your business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.marksdailyapple.com\/welcome-to-marks-daily-apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;cut out the sugar and carbs&lt;\/a&gt;. They cause your &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/01\/opinion\/sunday\/what-really-makes-us-fat.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;body to get fat&lt;\/a&gt; and they also sap you of energy and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.kurzweilai.net\/high-carb-foods-associated-with-cognitive-impairment-mayo-clinic-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;brain power&lt;\/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re serious about the success of your business then you owe it to yourself to eat the right food that will give you the most possible brain power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Let Yourself Get Good Sleep Every Night&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;#8217;s time to break the idea that there is no time to sleep. If you&amp;#8217;re not sleeping then you&amp;#8217;re ridding yourself of the energy and health you need to be at your best. There is a stigma in the business world that it&amp;#8217;s good to work all the time. It&amp;#8217;s like a rite of passage to work 20 hour days for a full week.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stop it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Get 8 hours of sleep each night. Plan your next day so you&amp;#8217;re not thinking about your business when you go to bed. Read stories before bed time to get your mind on something else and drift off to sleep.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found that I do much better work if I put a task off until tomorrow and do it when I wake up refreshed. If I try to kill it late into the night I do worse work on it and become extremely tired the next day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been there. It&amp;#8217;s difficult to remove yourself from certain aspects of your startup business, but it&amp;#8217;s necessary if you want to get your life back and to grow your business. You simply can&amp;#8217;t do everything and most of the time it&amp;#8217;s easy to get caught up doing things that aren&amp;#8217;t even important.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Follow this advice and your business should grow and you should get your health and happiness back too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Are you doing everything for your startup?
