It&amp;#8217;s important to understands sales can be a result of blogging. In fact, all marketing initiatives should be about profit in some shape or form. For most businesses blogging is proving to be a way to drive revenue.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I came across two more examples of blogs being responsible for sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Blogging for Sales&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first example is a person I&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/content-marketing-2011\"&gt;highlighted before&lt;\/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Kevin Hillstrom of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/minethatdata.com\/\"&gt;Mine That Data&lt;\/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re not following &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/minethatdata\"&gt;@minethatdata&lt;\/a&gt; on Twitter it&amp;#8217;s worth your while to add him to your stream. He&amp;#8217;s full of in depth marketing analytics useful for marketers in all fields.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin was tweeting recently and I had to ask him yet again to confirm his revenue from blogging.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Kevin Hillstrom Blog Revenue&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/DayneShuda\/status\/53819373961482240\"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-439\" title=\"Mine Data Revenue\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Mine-Data-Revenue.jpg\" alt=\"Mine Data Revenue\" width=\"550\" height=\"289\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/minethatdata\/status\/53840786508361728\"&gt;&lt;img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-442\" title=\"Mine Data Blogging Sales\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Mine-Data-Blogging-Sales.jpg\" alt=\"Mine Data Blogging Sales\" width=\"550\" height=\"182\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin was nice enough to respond to my question on blogging revenue and generating sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note Kevin is a consultant. He&amp;#8217;s a business-to-business guy attempting to generate sales from other businesses. He&amp;#8217;s mentioned in the past and I&amp;#8217;ve noticed in my work as well that B2B seems to be at more of an advantage for generating sales from blogging.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin is one example, but it&amp;#8217;s a growing trend in the B2B world that blogging can generates sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible for businesses to start blogs and generate sales. It&amp;#8217;s important to understand what will gain the attention of readers and how to turn that attention into revenue. Mostly I like to think of the questions people have and try to answer the best I can. Beyond that I look to build a trust or respect making it easier for someone to purchase from me or the business I&amp;#8217;m blogging for.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. HubSpot Blog Revenue Data&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HubSpot is becoming a leader in what they&amp;#8217;ve coined Inbound Marketing &amp;#8211; the art of gaining the attention of people through blogging, social media, and SEO. I like to think those three things go together for a great marketing strategy and I&amp;#8217;m sure the folks at Hubspot agree.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other day HubSpot released another great article on their blog and it included some great information and a slideshow. One of the slides from the presentation captured my attention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/11501\/How-an-e-Commerce-Company-Boosted-Web-Traffic-600-without-Spending-a-Dime-on-Advertising.aspx?source=Blog_Email_[How+an+e-Commerce+Co]\"&gt;How an e-Commerce Company Boosted Web Traffic 600% without Spending a Dime on &amp;#8220;Advertising&amp;#8221;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/11501\/How-an-e-Commerce-Company-Boosted-Web-Traffic-600-without-Spending-a-Dime-on-Advertising.aspx?source=Blog_Email_[How+an+e-Commerce+Co]\"&gt;&lt;img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" title=\"HubSpot Blog Sales\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/HubSpot-Blog-Sales.jpg\" alt=\"HubSpot Blog Sales\" width=\"545\" height=\"387\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a huge number of businesses seeing sales as a result of their blog. And the interesting thing about attribution lately is some channels &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/econsultancy.com\/uk\/blog\/7229-social-media-and-seo-massively-undervalued-study\"&gt;may be under valued&lt;\/a&gt;. As marketers work out the attribution it will be interesting to see the value blogs get in the mix for revenue generating.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too bad HubSpot didn&amp;#8217;t share if their data is from B2C or B2B. With those high results I&amp;#8217;d guess more B2B, but you never know. E-tailers are starting to experiment more with blogs and I&amp;#8217;m sure the most successful are seeing their influence and thought leadership lead to sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll guess at some point the blogging revenue number will becoming significant to the profit for B2C companies as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sales are coming in for businesses via their blogging initiatives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As more companies blog in the coming years the revenue share generated by blogging vs. other channels should continue to grow as well. Companies are seeing the benefits a blog can provide to their customers and are taking the initiative to create useful content as a way to get found and build trust.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does your company have a blog?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are your struggles with your blog or what is stopping you from blogging?&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;The studies keep coming in regarding sales and how blogging can generate revenue for a business.
