But it\u2019s altogether too easy to place added importance on these things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like a normal thing to do. But when we add too much importance to outcomes, we end up obsessing over the smallest of details \u2013 be it the rise and fall of traffic to our websites, a text that wasn\u2019t responded to, or a conversation that wasn\u2019t as inspiring as the last.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the outcome of every action takes on too much importance, it\u2019s almost as though we restrict the flow of support and assistance that can naturally and easily come into our lives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One must learn to surrender.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The More Important It Seems, the Greater the Need for Surrender&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is quite natural that you attach importance to things that matter to you \u2013 your business, your investments, your relationships, and so on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though outcomes aren\u2019t guaranteed in these categories, it\u2019s easy to assign importance to them:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI need this investment to pay off. If it doesn\u2019t, I could go broke.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want this relationship to work out because I\u2019m tired of having my heart broken.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s very natural to think this way. The challenge is that the harder you try to hold on to outcomes, the less they will seem to come together how you want them to. Without thinking, you will act in a manipulative, controlling, desperate way that pushes others away and hinders progress.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The more important it seems, the greater there is a need to surrender.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How to Reduce Importance &amp;amp; Practice Surrender&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surrendering begins with noticing when your communication is coming from a place of fixing or surviving. When you\u2019re trying to fix or survive a situation, you will inevitably be stuck in a cycle of:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li aria-level=\"1\"&gt;Forcing and controlling outcomes&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li aria-level=\"1\"&gt;Convincing and commanding others&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And rarely if ever do these cycles lead to meaningful progress.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notice when the above is happening and stop. Then, choose different words or different actions. Some ways of communicating don\u2019t involve controlling, convincing, or commanding. For example, you can paint a vision of what\u2019s possible, thereby inspiring others in the process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, consider your hobbies or what you like to do in your spare time. Chances are there are areas of your life that are thriving naturally, without your constant, desperate attention. Learn from that. See if you can take the same attitude toward areas of your life that matter most to you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Enjoy the Benefits of Surrender&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you surrender outcomes, you will feel freer. You will learn to be satisfied with your best effort versus comparing yourself to others. Surrender will also make room for divine assistance to move on your behalf. You do your best; the Universe does its best.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surrender leaves room for others to contribute to you. It gives them a chance to bring opportunities to the table. Everything seems to work better when you\u2019re in surrender.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surrendering works because it reduces the importance you\u2019ve placed on certain outcomes. It has you showing up differently in everything you\u2019re doing. It allows you to be more present to the opportunities around you and leaves space for others to contribute to you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It may seem like placing more importance on outcomes would make them happen sooner and faster, but that\u2019s just some version of forcing and controlling, and it doesn\u2019t work. Detach yourself from outcomes. That\u2019s true surrender.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;We all have things we\u2019re looking to accomplish in life.
