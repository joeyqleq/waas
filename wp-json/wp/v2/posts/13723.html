I&amp;#8217;m an introvert. I like my quiet. I like being alone most of the time. I seem to get energy from recharging my batteries after doing things like reading a book or taking a walk and things like that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But in recent years I&amp;#8217;ve learned that sparking up conversations with strangers can be a good thing. Obviously you get to meet new people and learn about their lives a little bit. It kind of broadens your worldview and you can really learn a lot about the world outside of your own.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find that it also helps with my business life. I&amp;#8217;m comfortable talking on the phone with new people. I&amp;#8217;m more likely to reach out to someone new that I haven&amp;#8217;t met before.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve thought a little about this change in my life and I think it comes from my daughter. She is still young, but she is very friendly and excited to meet new people. I drop her off at school in the morning and she&amp;#8217;s saying hello to multiple people before we even walk in the door. Then we get inside and she&amp;#8217;s saying hello to people and waving and they&amp;#8217;re all smiling back.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s the same way wherever we go in the world. Stores, apple orchards, parks and more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m definitely learning from her that there are benefits to talking to strangers. Here are some of the things I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a little.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Talk To Store Clerks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to talk to strangers is to talk to people at local businesses. Again, I&amp;#8217;ve never been great about this. I go about my business and kind of keep to myself. But in recent years I&amp;#8217;ve started smiling at folks in the stores. I&amp;#8217;ve started to say hello to them. Maybe mention something from the day. Maybe ask them a quick question. You kind of learn the more you do it. The small talk gets better. The conversations are comfortable for each person involved.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find that most people like to feel like others are interested in them. You don&amp;#8217;t want to badger someone with questions, but asking a question or two is usually good and if the person seems interested then a followup can usually do the trick.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just last week the FedEx delivery guy was dropping off a package. He noticed that it was from an outdoors brand and he asked a simple question. We found some common ground and pretty soon a few minutes had gone by and he let me know that he had to get back on the truck. But it was a nice conversation and a chance to learn a little about each other.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leagues &amp;amp; Games&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things is being part of a golf league each week during the summer here in Wisconsin. I enjoy golf, but it&amp;#8217;s also a time for me to get out into the world a little. I&amp;#8217;ve worked at home for a decade so I don&amp;#8217;t have the office setting anymore as part of my social world. At golf I get to see a lot of the same people each week.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But there are also opportunities to meet new people. I might head to the bar before the round for a drink. That usually offers a chance to meet someone new and chat for a bit. Usually there is already a little common interest in golf. So conversations can build from the one piece of common interest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Business Networking Events&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These have never been my favorite. But I&amp;#8217;m beginning to see the benefit more and more as I get older. These are opportunities to work on communication skills that are great for business. Again, I find that asking questions usually results in the best conversations. Just getting to know someone a little bit. Maybe finding common ground and expanding from there. When you find a topic of interest people are usually excited to dive into more details.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter has brought many great things to my life. One of them is the understanding that it can be good to talk to strangers. It can be a learning opportunity. It can lead to great relationships. And it&amp;#8217;s relationships that seem to be a key to a life well lived.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Talking to strangers isn&amp;#8217;t comfortable to most people.
