You still remember how they made you feel. What they made you think. How they made you act after the encounter.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Were they trying to do that or did it just happen to occur?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, it seems powerful to leave a lasting impression on others. For business. For personal life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how does one do it?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s examine&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Leave A Lasting Impression Tips&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No Time Limit&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show Curiosity, Don&amp;#8217;t Judge&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Open Your Eyes&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take Unique Positions&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;No Time Limit&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read articles and books about successful people. Some that have made impressions on others and some that haven&amp;#8217;t. You get a sense of others when you talk to people they&amp;#8217;ve been around.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For good or bad, right or wrong, many politicians have the power to leave a lasting impression when they meet others. Especially in one on one settings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;#8217;ve read about politicians is that the best ones often make you feel like they have all the time in the world for you. Obviously most people don&amp;#8217;t have all the time in the world. Successful people are often busy. They have a lot of things they could be doing with their time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the ones that leave an impression seem to be the ones that act as if they have all the time in world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And think about your interactions with others. Especially in the world of smartphones. It&amp;#8217;s not a good feeling when the person we&amp;#8217;re talking to looks at their phone. Yet we do it\u00a0&lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;\/em&gt; to each other. And before that we would glance at our watch. A moment&amp;#8217;s thought of what time is it and when will this be over.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving a lasting impression is making someone feel like they have your entire attention. You shut the rest of the world out and you don&amp;#8217;t care how long it takes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By doing this you can even make a short period, say a few minutes, feel like a long time. And you can make an impression.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say you&amp;#8217;re going to a meeting to make a big sales pitch. You will probably spend a couple minutes in the lobby with the receptionist.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can make a lasting impression with that person with a good interaction. If you give that person your entire attention as if you had all the time in the world it will be good for them and good for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes practice. You have to give up some control of time and immerse yourself in the conversation. And that comes with a few other tips below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Show Curiosity, Don&amp;#8217;t Judge&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think good listening is a reaction to curiosity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes curiosity comes easy. We talk with someone that does something we&amp;#8217;re truly interested in. For example, if I were to meet a professional golfer I would be very interested in asking them about their profession. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to\u00a0&lt;em&gt;try&lt;\/em&gt; to be curious.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if someone was a landscaper, for example, I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t be instantly interested and curious. But I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to find little nuggets of curiosity with everyone I meet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if someone tells me they&amp;#8217;re a landscaper I&amp;#8217;ll ask them how they make mulch different colors. I&amp;#8217;ll ask them what the driver is for making a profit. Are some things more profitable than others or is it all based on man hours spent working.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can bring it back to something I&amp;#8217;m interested in. I&amp;#8217;m interested in the outdoors so the mulch question might touch on my interest in the outdoors and trees and things like that. I also like business so the profit question can touch on my curiosity in business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to be about finding connections. Not taking the person completely out of their realm, but finding a way to connection so that you&amp;#8217;re both interested in the topic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And with curiosity naturally comes non-judgement. You don&amp;#8217;t want to start asking leading questions where you prepare yourself to judge the person.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Say you hate oil and gas and you&amp;#8217;re talking with someone in the drilling industry. You have to be really careful because you might ask questions without being truly curious. There has to be a genuine interest in learning.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Open Your Eyes&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This from a psychologist:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The physical feature that is remembered most clearly following initial interactions are our eyes &amp;#8212; especially their color. Eyes that are bright and open send a message of curiosity, the desire to get to know someone and let others know you.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s pretty powerful. I have bad habit of looking away and averting my eyes in conversation. I\u00a0&lt;em&gt;know&lt;\/em&gt; that it makes me look uninterested and unconfident.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I may be those things a lot of the time. But to leave a lasting impression I need to do the opposite. If I divert my eyes I&amp;#8217;m like 95% of the other people the other person talks with in their daily happenings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a trick. Look the person in one eye and really examine their eye. Look at the details. See if you can make a lasting impression of them on yourself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you do that then you&amp;#8217;ll be making great eye contact and they&amp;#8217;ll likely do the same with you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Build&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build the person up, don&amp;#8217;t tear them down.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to be judged or brought down in a conversation or interaction. We remember people that do this for all the wrong reasons and we likely won&amp;#8217;t ever want to work with that person. We might want to get back at them, but never work with them in a positive way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are attracted to people that make us feel good. That empower us. That make us feel inspired and like we can do anything.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But we have to be careful with building people. Often we can think that we should give &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/cutting-back-on-unsolicited-advice\"&gt;advice&lt;\/a&gt; when the other person may not want advice or may not be ready to receive our advice.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advice is great. But it usually has to come after the other person has gone through their entire story. They feel like you understand them. And they&amp;#8217;ve asked you, often repeatedly for your thoughts on a situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Go into conversations thinking about what you can learn from the other person and how you can build the other person up to be better than they were before your conversation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit of a tall task, but even if you leave the other person feeling a little bit better you&amp;#8217;ll have a good chance of being memorable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Take Unique Positions&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re like everyone else you&amp;#8217;ll fade into the background.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This can come in the form of the questions you ask and in the answers you give to questions. Or the responses you give to expressions and statements.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the person says, &amp;#8220;It sure is raining hard today.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The common phrase that most of us say is, &amp;#8220;It sure is.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not very memorable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But what if we say, &amp;#8220;I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a rain like this since driveway gave out at my grandparent&amp;#8217;s farm.&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That could lead to a story. It&amp;#8217;s something the other person probably hasn&amp;#8217;t heard a thousand times before.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We remember people that say unusual things. Sometimes a little quirky. Maybe even a little awkward sometimes, but unusual and different. Not the usual cliches that most of trot out when we&amp;#8217;re talking with others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leaving A Good Impression&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, just a note here that it&amp;#8217;s best to focus on leaving a\u00a0&lt;em&gt;good lasting impression&lt;\/em&gt;. You can certainly leave a bad lasting impression on people. You could insult them. You could be awkward and one-sided in the conversation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re aiming for good lasting impressions. And if your heart is in the right place. If you&amp;#8217;re in a place of non-judgement with the goal of learning and building then you&amp;#8217;re in the right place to leave a good lasting impression.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Leaving a lasting impression seems good, right?
