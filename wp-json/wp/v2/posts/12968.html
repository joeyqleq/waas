You definitely don&amp;#8217;t want to be losing customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of big and little things you can do to boost retention. The most important is the quality and value you provide with your product or service. But most businesses want to go beyond that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing you might be interested is how business blogging can help with retention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Email Newsletter&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email has been around for 20+ years. It&amp;#8217;s still a main way that people use the Internet. Email marketing is not necessarily easy. But the simple strategy you can use is to provide content that educates and\/or entertains your subscribers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can create an email that is just for customers. With this you can also create blog posts that you share in the email that are just for customers. You can send it out every week or every month. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t necessarily do it more than that with email. This seems to be the accepted frequency. You could even do 4-5 posts a month and share them all in the monthly email.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/101-content-ideas\/\"&gt;big list&lt;\/a&gt; of what you can blog about. Just keep the focus on what your customers would be interested in for education or entertainment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Case Studies&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Case studies on your blog can also help with customer retention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, you can engage a customer to participate in a case study. This is a way to feature their business that can lead to more customers for them. By creating a case study, you&amp;#8217;re getting the customer more involved with your company. The more involved and invested they are in your success the more likely they are to stay for the long-term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Second, case studies can provide insight to other current customers on how others are using your products and services. Most businesses do multiple things. Most customers don&amp;#8217;t use every product or service. But if they read a case study about another product they may become interested in buying it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Quotes&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the more involved customers are with you the more invested they are in your success. That leads to retention. You can do blog posts where you ask customers for quotes about the topic. This doesn&amp;#8217;t have to take a lot of time. It can be done with a quick call, email or text. The customer then gets to see their name in the content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say you sell UTVs in your area. You ask customers what they like best about a certain model. You add those quotes to a feature post you&amp;#8217;re doing on the model. This provides value to future customers and also gives current customers an investment in what you&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Referral Material&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most people are social media. They like sharing content and getting engagement from the people they know. Your blog content, especially if it has quotes and things like that, is something your customers may want to share. If it features them they will share it and that can lead to referrals. When someone refers a business they are very likely to be invested in the company for the long-term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogging is great for attracting new customers. But it can also help boost customer retention. But you have to use the blog content in a slightly different way. You have to create some posts with current customers in mind.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are doing this. There is no reason you can&amp;#8217;t do it as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Customer retention is obviously important.
