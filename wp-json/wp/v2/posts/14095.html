It can be a lot of things. It&amp;#8217;s often exciting. But you kind of want to skip through the early stages to get to where you&amp;#8217;re feeling confident and good about the new situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may feel a little uneasy about meeting new coworkers. You&amp;#8217;re wondering if you have the right experience. There is always the pressure of learning new processes and tasks.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thoughts on how to build your confidence in a new job.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Reframe Negative Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we do anything new, even something that we have experience doing, we often make a few mistakes. Or we do something a little differently. We&amp;#8217;re out of our comfort zone. It&amp;#8217;s easy to feel negative about the situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You have to watch out for those thoughts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may start saying and thinking little things to yourself like:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t believe I forgot that step.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Remind yourself that you&amp;#8217;re probably flooded with new things. Your brain is a little frazzled. You&amp;#8217;re not on auto-pilot like you probably were in your previous position. It will take a little while to adapt to your new surroundings and responsibilities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can frame these things positively in different ways such as:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright, that&amp;#8217;s okay. I&amp;#8217;m glad it happened now and not later.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Pay Attention To The Progress&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each day you&amp;#8217;ll improve. You&amp;#8217;re capable of the job. That&amp;#8217;s why they hired you. You&amp;#8217;re going to make progress and you&amp;#8217;re probably going to make quick progress. Don&amp;#8217;t focus necessarily on where you want to be. Focus on how you&amp;#8217;re improving compared to when you first began.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Golf instructor Hank Haney talked about this in relation to his time coaching Tiger Woods. He said that people often compared Tiger Woods when he was working with Hank to when he was at his best with his previous coach, Butch Harmon.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But Hank liked to look at how Tiger improved from the time he left Butch to the time he started working with Hank. The Tiger Woods of 2005-2009 was much improved from the Tiger of 2003-2004, when he didn&amp;#8217;t have a coach.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Try to frame yourself and abilities in the proper perspective.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Your Coworkers Want You To Do Well&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school we had a sales competition. When I walked in front of the panel one of the judges mentioned that he and the others wanted me to do well. It&amp;#8217;s instantly hit me as one of those life moments. The kind that you remember.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true for so much of life. People want you to be great. Especially when it involves them. They want great coworkers. They want people that are trustworthy and hardworking and supportive. Nobody is watching to see if you fail.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just realizing this should help boost your confidence.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Reflect On Daily Positives&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each day as you&amp;#8217;re packing up and getting ready to leave take a moment to think about the positives. There are always a few positives that occur even if it was a bit stressful as you learn new things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you met a new coworker. Maybe your boss smiled when she saw something you did. Maybe you met a vendor that was really nice. Maybe you remembered a step in a process that you missed yesterday.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The little wins will keep you going.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Make New Connections&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever you start a new job you get the chance to meet new people. And work is often where we make some great friendships. I met my wife at our first workplace after college. That wasn&amp;#8217;t the intention, but it worked out great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have to meet a spouse. But you can meet great people. You can interact just at work or you could become great friends both in and out of the office.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the connections help to bring happiness and confidence to your life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new job can be intimidating. Everyone has been there. They know the ins and outs. You&amp;#8217;re probably qualified and will do great. But it&amp;#8217;s difficult starting from scratch. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling like your confidence is lacking a little bit hopefully these little tips will help. Because you are great and you will get even better the longer you&amp;#8217;re there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job is exciting.
