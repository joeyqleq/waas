While all businesses that start a blog have the right idea not all succeed in their blogging initiatives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found that a big reason for blogging failure is the inability to set the proper expectations when starting a blog. Businesses that start a blog often expect too much too soon from a blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience I&amp;#8217;ve noticed a few key things that determine the success or failure of most blogs. There are more variables, but these next three seem to be near universal.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Business Blog Expectations&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Frequency&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most blogs build traffic either through natural search traffic or by obtaining regular followers (community). Both of these types of traffic are highly dependent on the frequency of posting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A simple rule of thought is: The more your post, the more traffic you receive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When starting a blog the frequency is a key variable in determining the type of traffic growth you can expect. There is not a right or wrong frequency for your blog. Each blog strategy will have a different frequency required and it depends mostly on the available resources for posting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A basic rule of thumb I&amp;#8217;ve noticed is you can expect relatively little traffic for the first few months for a blog that posts once a week. For a blog that posts once a month it may take a year to start seeing any traffic at all. A blog that posts daily can start to see some traction within a month or two. What I mean by traction will be an increase in traffic from search engines and potential some sharing sites. This traffic may start out as just a handful of visits each day to ten or twenty per day for a blog with daily posts. This traffic should continue increasing at a good rate if the frequency continues.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a basic expectation and can vary based on other variables including the next two.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Voice&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The voice of the blog is important even for a business blog. Readers are drawn to the voice of the blog more than they are drawn even to the content of a blog. People look to other people for viewpoints and interpretation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I like to read as much news about the Green Bay Packers as I can. There are many writers and bloggers. They all cover the basic same news topics that come out about the team each week. What I&amp;#8217;m drawn to as a reader and a fan are how each blogger and writer interprets the news. If the team happens to lose the game one week I look for interpretation of why and how they lost. I want to understand how my favorite team lost and I need someone to tell me that. If I&amp;#8217;m looking for condolence I look for a blogger with a compassionate voice.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A blogging voice is the voice of the blogger. The personality needs to come out from the person writing a blog. I&amp;#8217;ve noticed that blogs with high traffic often have bloggers that tend to walk the edge of making 50% of the readers happy and the other 50% angry. The more disagreement amongst readers the better in most cases. It leads to a lot of interaction and repeat traffic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now controversy doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be insulting or entirely negative. There are ways to write blog posts that attract attention without damaging a brand. This is of course important for most companies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Topic&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The topic of the blog is an important variable in determining the success of a blog. Not all businesses will find success with blogging. If a business that is extremely specialized with just a few potential clients may not benefit as much from a blog as a marketing consulting firm may.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogs about marketing tactics and strategy are plentiful because there are many business looking for quality individuals to help market their business. There aren&amp;#8217;t as many blogs about toothpicks&amp;#8230;although maybe there could be a few more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The more people interested in your topic the more potential readers you&amp;#8217;ll have. Simple.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Business Blogging&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For your business blog it&amp;#8217;s important to know what to expect. The success of your blog depends on how you expect the blog to perform over time. If you think you can post 3 times each week with a strong blogging voice in a fairly popular topic can expect perhaps a few hundred page views a month after a couple to three months. This can of course vary and if you catch fire it can leave to more traffic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With blogging targeting keywords it&amp;#8217;s a good bet a blog strategy like this can bring in some relevant traffic that can convert to sales while improving customer relations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are your experiences with blogs?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you started a blog that has been successful?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you started a blog that has struggled?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A common struggle I see is that people set expectations too high for their blog and that leads to abandonment after only a few months of hard work. It&amp;#8217;s common. The goal of Ghost Blog Writers is to make sure those business blogs make it past their first year &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s when the magic can start happening.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/aussiegall\/391044589\/\"&gt;Moon&lt;\/a&gt; image courtesy of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/aussiegall\/391044589\/\"&gt;aussiegall&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;When starting a business blog it&amp;#8217;s important to set the proper expectations.
