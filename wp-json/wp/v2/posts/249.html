He takes a common sense approach to SEO, business, blogging, and life it seems. He is able to take very dry and very analytical information and turn it into digestible content. I love following his blog posts because he makes it easy for novices like me to understand seemingly difficult material.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I searched the SEOmoz blog for some information on blogging. I figured it&amp;#8217;d be worth it to gather some insight from a company with experience growing a business partly through the success of a business blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I came across a post that was over three years old, but there was a great bit of insight from Rand:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"Grow Your Business Blogging has brought SEOmoz an incredible amount of business inquiries over the last 3 years, and the rate of emails asking us for assistance accelerates every week (last week, I counted more than 2 dozen unique requests, all of whom I sent here).

This is the type of insight I find valuable on SEOmoz&amp;#8217;s blog. Check out the entire post for more reasons why you should blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Why Your Company Should Blog&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back to blogging. The article on Rand in the Puget Sound Business Journal highlights the point that Rand&amp;#8217;s company started out as a consulting company that blogged. The company kind of morphed into a site that SEO consultants and companies now use to gain SEO knowledge on a wide basis. There is a forum where questions can be answered for SEOmoz pro members. SEOmoz also offers a variety of SEO tools companies can use to improve their SEO.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And of course SEOmoz still maintains a successful blog including a member blog &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.seomoz.org\/ugc\"&gt;Youmoz&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rand&amp;#8217;s company is proof that blogging can not only improve your business it may be essential to success. SEOmoz&amp;#8217;s blog generates scores of new visits and has thousands of subscribers. All of those people are either already pro members or potential pro members. The company&amp;#8217;s model was built on writing content people wanted.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the post about why you should blog, Rand points out some simple understandings about business &amp;#8211; people will buy from you because they know you, like you, and trust you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your business blog can accomplish all of these things over time as you share your insight, personality, and reflections with your potential customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/notsogoodphotography\/2017430623\/\"&gt;Falling&lt;\/a&gt; image courtesy of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/notsogoodphotography\/2017430623\/\"&gt;notsogoodphotography&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a blog post on one of my favorites sites &amp;#8211; SEOmoz.org.
