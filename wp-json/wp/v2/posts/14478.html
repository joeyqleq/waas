Here\u2019s why.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;\u201cBut I Haven\u2019t Seen it on Social Media Yet\u201d&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Has this happened to you? You\u2019ve spent countless hours in research and development, building the sales page, and creating the product. You finally launch, only to be disappointed by the uptake.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not just that, but the word gets back to you that your customers are skeptical because they haven\u2019t even seen your product on social media yet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it either takes time, money, or both for you to gain the visibility you need for your product on social media. But that\u2019s just the acorn. The forest resulting from the acorn is that there are a litany of tasks that must be completed before anyone has any trust in the idea that your product even exists and is worthy of their attention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And let\u2019s not forget \u2013 cutting through the noise is not going to happen overnight. The &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.krusecontrolinc.com\/rule-of-7-how-social-media-crushes-old-school-marketing-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Rule of 7&lt;\/a&gt; says you need to get your message in front of your prospect seven times before you can even expect them to take action or make a purchase.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You Need a Marketing Checklist&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have one already. But we can never forget that good things take time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you\u2019ve achieved a level of notoriety or critical mass, it\u2019s safe to say most people don\u2019t care about your product launch, and worse, some people are wondering when you\u2019re ever going to get around to offering support for the course you launched two years ago.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the most out of your latest launch, you must put your full support behind it and take a renewed, holistic perspective at activity to include in your marketing checklist. You\u2019ve got to prioritize high leverage tasks too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;It Isn\u2019t Just About Focus&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In developing your marketing stamina, focus is obviously going to make a difference. But it isn\u2019t just about focus. It\u2019s also about knowing what your product can do and putting your full confidence behind it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Popular musical artists and bands don\u2019t just perform once in their hometown and call it a day. They go on world tours, fulfilling on hundreds of tour dates. They don\u2019t even move on until their audience has had their fill, sometimes giving repeat performances in certain cities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren\u2019t touring, you will need to be constantly developing new marketing assets to keep the marketing momentum going. And that requires stamina too. You can\u2019t get bored of your product. You need to commit to getting it in front of as many people as possible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing stamina matters because competing for attention in a noisy world is hard. If you &lt;em&gt;really &lt;\/em&gt;want your product to be seen, you\u2019ve got to put some serious energy behind it. And it will take time to do everything you can possibly do to promote it and gather social proof.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs and businesses alike sometimes get caught up in the sheer number of product and services opportunities they could create for their target customers.
