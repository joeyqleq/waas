Darth Vader, Dr. Evil, certain psychopaths in the headlines. No one thinks of themselves as a dictator.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But dictators in business are a common bunch. They\u2019re just not so easy to spot because they don\u2019t wear a pitch-black exoskeleton. If you\u2019re a leader in business looking to avoid the dark side, you need to know these 3 key differences between a leader and a dictator.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leaders Inspire, Not Intimidate&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Telling an employee, if they don\u2019t get a certain task done on Friday, to not bother coming in on Monday is a classic dictator move.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dictators use intimidation and fear to ply their employees into getting the job done. The most common fear tactic is the threat of being fired. But dictators can also threaten a demotion, lost vacation time, or a pay cut to get what they want.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trouble with intimidation\u2014besides the obvious\u2014is that the dictator always has to step in and make threats. Intimidation is a drain on the dictator\u2019s time and energy. Threatened employees will simply never care enough to do the work without the dictator\u2019s intervention.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccl.org\/articles\/leading-effectively-articles\/characteristics-good-leader\/\"&gt;Inspiring leaders model the behavior&lt;\/a&gt; and work ethic they wish to see from their team. Leaders understand that, on the whole, people want to work hard and do well. If their team falls behind on a project, leaders step in with extra effort. They show up early and stay until the job is finished, knowing their employees will follow their example.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leaders Create a Team, Not Rivalry&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rivalries can crop up in many ways. Sometimes a seemingly benign competition can undercut the unity of your team. A sales competition in which there\u2019s only one winner can create a rivalry that harms the whole business. Sometimes, dictators create rivalry through a kind of emotional blackmail. Playing favorites or ignoring employees when you\u2019re unhappy with them is a subtle tactic of tyrants.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leaders understand that creating competition between team members often backfires. Rivalries erode teamwork. And in the absence of strong teams, employees are less engaged, less creative, and less productive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leaders know that teamwork amplifies individual strengths and talents. They help their employees see their own strengths as well as the talents of their teammates. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/236546\/keys-building-high-performance-culture.aspx\"&gt;Teams with a strong leader&lt;\/a&gt; know that an individual\u2019s success boosts the entire team.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leaders Empower Employees&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dictators, on the other hand, bulldoze their employees. They see themselves as their employees\u2019 boss. They see their employees as tools to accomplish various tasks. The problem with managing as a \u201cboss\u201d is similar to managing with intimidation. Bosses always have to oversee employees to ensure they are doing the right task at the right time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/cliftonstrengths\/en\/278225\/how-to-improve-teamwork.aspx#ite-282812\"&gt;Leaders see themselves as a coach&lt;\/a&gt; or mentor to their team members. Recognizing each employee\u2019s strength, a leader encourages the employee to use their talents in their daily work. They give their employees space to use creative solutions in their tasks. When leaders empower their employees, they\u2019re increasing both engagement and innovation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Leaders Are EQ Geniuses&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s easier than you think to slip into dictator mode. Any number of workplace stressors can have you bossing your team around like B-movie villain. And therein lies the real difference between leaders and dictators: degree of emotional intelligence. Dictators may excuse their tactics as necessary to achieve business goals. But in fact, dictators are eliciting a host of negative emotions to get their way. They rule by making their employees feel inadequate or fearful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But when you choose to be a leader, you\u2019re inspiring and empowering your team. Your positive leadership style will build up your employees and help them accomplish more. Not only will you avoid the tired trope of the \u201chorrible boss,\u201d you\u2019ll take your team\u2019s productivity and success to new superhuman heights.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;When most people hear the word \u201cdictator,\u201d they think of some outrageous characters.
