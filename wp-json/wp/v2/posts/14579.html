Experienced marketers, on the other hand, know the value of creating and sticking to a plan.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And while there\u2019s nothing particularly exciting about content calendars, it\u2019s the very essence of strategy. And smart marketers know they must plant their flag on the mount of strategy rather than ephemeral tactics if they desire long-term success.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s why content calendars are more crucial than ever.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Strategy is the Enemy of Success&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blogging and content marketing have never been more competitive. Most savvy marketers today know all the best tricks, be it the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/skyscraper-technique\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Skyscraper Technique&lt;\/a&gt;, content upgrades, the latest in backlink building, or otherwise.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are not clear on what you\u2019re publishing and when, as well as what keywords you\u2019re targeting and what the competitive landscape is, you will have a tough time ranking for any terms, let alone driving traffic to your website and converting visitors into leads.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not all content needs a keyword focus, but all content needs a purpose. Mapping out your content plan three months out gives you and your audience a clear picture of what\u2019s to come. It also gives you opportunities to course adjust long before you\u2019re under the gun to produce a long-form blog post on a tight deadline.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Content Calendars Give You a Competitive Advantage&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, the best publications already have a content calendar and a good idea of what they will be publishing when, as well as why. But it\u2019s fair to say that most run-of-the-mill bloggers, and even small- to medium-sized businesses, don\u2019t have that kind of foresight let alone acumen to know why content calendars matter so much.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Setting up your content calendar will give you a distinct competitive advantage, especially if you plan your content around themes. One month is generally a good amount of time to cover a topic and generate excitement for.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Further, most of your target audience won\u2019t see all your posts, so by sticking to a specific topic for longer, you have a better chance of reaching a wider audience with your content. This is critical, especially when sharing key messages with your audience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Hard Way is the Easy Way&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting from the hip and making stuff up as you go may seem like the fun, creative way to remain agile and innovative, especially in creating content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But unless your company is represented by an attractive character, like Neil Patel, Brian Dean, or Russell Brunson, there\u2019s a good chance talking about anything you want to talk about at the moment won\u2019t get you anywhere in producing measurable ROI. Plus, you\u2019ll probably end up staring at a blank canvas more often than you might expect.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.scotthyoung.com\/blog\/2020\/05\/11\/hard-is-easy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;hard way is the easy way&lt;\/a&gt;. When there is a plan in place, less time is devoted to thinking about \u201cthe what,\u201d and more time and energy can be dedicated to \u201cthe why\u201d and to producing a better-finished product.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What works for one won\u2019t always work for another, but a content calendar is something every ambitious blogger or company should have. It guides the strategic direction of the content being produced so that better outcomes can be produced short term and long term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;New marketers are usually quick to run to the latest trending tactics to gain attention for their products and services.
