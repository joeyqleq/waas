You might be feeling tired all week and doing something just seems out of the question. Maybe you want to find a new job, but the idea of doing all the work just to make a change seems daunting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could just be in a rut. Things are fine. You&amp;#8217;re doing good work. But that&amp;#8217;s about it. You&amp;#8217;re not feeling the push to go really above and beyond.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all been there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thoughts for finding motivation back&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Set Exact Goals&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Goals are great for achieving things. But they typically have to be specific. Losing 10 pounds instead of losing weight. Making 10 cold calls this week instead of doing cold calls. That kind of things. The more specific you can be the better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But it has to be based on reality. You have to be likely to achieve it if you put in the work. Motivation can quickly go away if you start falling short on goals. If you do have big goals start with the big goal and then break it down into smaller goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Find Someone To Challenge&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in the workplace you need a little competition. You can still keep it friendly. Someone that does the same job as you that you&amp;#8217;re friendly with. Create a specific challenge for the month.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Local groups can be good for this as well. A networking group where you connect with other people in and out of your industry. Create a challenge that revolves around work for you and one other person.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Add A Carrot&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is something you&amp;#8217;ve been wanting? New golf clubs? A new car? A new riding lawn mower? It could be anything. Big and small. Try to put a little carrot in front of yourself as you work the next few months.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It could even be as simple as something to end the day with. You do 10 cold calls today and when you finish the 10th you close out for the day or go get an ice cream or something or listen to a podcast you&amp;#8217;ve been saving or watch a movie you&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to see.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Focus On Little Wins&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Big goals are tricky. You have to celebrate little successes and little bits of progress. You don&amp;#8217;t have to throw a party when you do something small, but do take the time to smile or just to appreciate what you&amp;#8217;ve done. You&amp;#8217;re moving in the right direction. That&amp;#8217;s a good thing. Keep the motivation going by acknowledging the progress.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Look At Your History&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s good to look back and reflect on how far you&amp;#8217;ve come. It can be easy to get lost in the moment. You feel stuck. But taking time to think back to where you were 10 years ago and where you are now can help.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can do a lot in a year, five years and 10 years. Focus on that. Change doesn&amp;#8217;t usually come all at once. Accomplishments don&amp;#8217;t come all at once.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Motivation isn&amp;#8217;t always easy to come by. And it can be fleeting. You have to watch out for the really short-term motivation. Ideas can be that kind. You have an idea for something. You get all excited. Then it falls by the wayside. That kind of motivation usually doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Focus on the items here and you should be able to get things rolling in the right direction.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Motivation can be difficult at certain times.
