Here is what Google is assuming about you:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search results, like warm cookies right out of the oven or cool refreshing fruit on a hot summer\u2019s day, are best when they\u2019re fresh. Even if you don\u2019t specify it in your search, you probably want search results that are relevant and recent.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So get ready because the latest content is going to become the most relevant content in some cases.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Google Freshness&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the most part I think this change makes sense. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking around for examples of the change and it seems like Google gets this right in most cases. The company has become very good at figuring out what people are looking for and while it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/branding-business-blog\"&gt;easy to find exceptions&lt;\/a&gt;, Google does a pretty good job all things considered.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the official post Google mentions that queries for sport event scores or tv shows will yield fresh content. If want older content for those terms and similar terms you&amp;#8217;ll have to get more specific with your searches and I&amp;#8217;m sure Google is fine with this change.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Google Freshness and Your Business&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a chance your business will be affected by this change. If you currently have content there is a slight chance that it might be pushed out of the top results for fresh content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If that is the case you&amp;#8217;re going to need to change strategy and create fresh content via something like a News section or even a blog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you company has been considering a blog there is no better reason to start one than now. There is opportunity to put in place a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/how-to-business-blogging-strategy\"&gt;blog strategy&lt;\/a&gt; targeting your customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Google is rewarding fresh content.
