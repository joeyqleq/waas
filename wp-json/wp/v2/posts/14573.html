And that means something about this topic sparks interest. Whether you\u2019re thinking about a career now or just wondering what your options are, stay tuned. It used to be that careers were meant to be linear, with 20+ years of loyal commitment that would result in a healthy retirement with benefits and stipends. That may have been your plan when you got started in your current profession. But you know darned good and well that today\u2019s economy, market demands, company trajectories, and management don\u2019t plan to follow those paths anymore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, you can wait around and hope you get the longevity you originally planned. You can cross your fingers and hope layoffs and buyouts don\u2019t derail your path. Or you can just job hop laterally to another company, hoping to avoid a sinking ship.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But are any of those options realistically any good?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More importantly, is it plausible that you could change career directions altogether at this point in the game? What if you could? Would you?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is \u2013 it\u2019s never too late to change your career goals. And here\u2019s how you go about unraveling your options, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/mindset-matters-7-tips-for-shifting-to-a-more-successful-life-perspective\/\"&gt;setting goals&lt;\/a&gt; that make sense, and convincing yourself it\u2019s absolutely ok to bail and plant your flag elsewhere.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to Consider a Career Change&lt;img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14574 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-789822-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Andrea Piacquadio: career\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-789822-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-789822-1.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The great aspect about making the decision to change careers is you don\u2019t owe anyone a reason or explanation. Don\u2019t feel obligated to justify your \u201cwhy.\u201d And for many professionals, a career change is necessary for a number of reasons that might also resonate with your situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;You\u2019re Looking for Burnout Relief&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employee burnout can happen at any career level and over any period of time. You might have loved your path at one point and felt connected to the company and the job in a meaningful way. But a lot (like a LOT) has changed over the last few years in workloads, company culture, and corporate decision-making. Mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion is a real phenomenon. And if you\u2019re struggling to maintain your work pace, burnout, and frustration are eminent. More importantly, you have every right to consider a change if your physical or mental health is at risk.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;You Crave Flexibility in Your Life&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pandemic shutdowns, shutters, and work-from-home dynamics changed peoples\u2019 perspectives about flexibility. And you might be considering a profession change because you now want to prioritize that flexibility in a work-life balance experience. Maybe you want to be around more for little league games or just dinnertime. Others want the flexibility to travel more or spend time with hobbies and loved ones. The rigid restrictions of a traditional workweek, requesting time off, waiting for approvals, etc., are no longer the norm. More employees are embracing hybrid work, remote work, and more flexible schedules. There are thousands of companies adopting these more flexible work requirements, too, meaning if you &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/starting-new-job\/how-to-change-careers-later-in-life\"&gt;decide to change careers&lt;\/a&gt; \u2013 you\u2019re likely to find a new role with the flexibility you need.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Work-Life Balance Matters&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burning both ends of the \u201ccareer\u201d candle might have been doable or expected at one point in your career. But overdoing and over-committing to the job is not always a sustainable path. Work-life balance and company culture carry more weight among workers today than ever before. And if you value your free time just as much as you value your career success, there are other employers out there ready to deliver.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;You Need Something More Fulfilling&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For many of today\u2019s career professionals, job fulfillment is an emerging priority. You may want to feel more connected to your job, with purpose and resolution. And if you\u2019re losing that fire or passion that you once had, no longer recognizing a valuable contribution in your work, it can be deflating. No one really wants to shuffle papers for 20 years. They\u2019ll want to know that paper shuffling has a purpose, directly connects with a value proposition, or contributes to the big-picture, greater good in some way. You should seriously consider a career change if you feel your current role and responsibilities don\u2019t represent the meaning they once did.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Later-in-Life Career Changes Can Ignite for a Number of Reasons&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re like me, career changes become imminent because of circumstances or company situations that are out of your control. You might still love your job and appreciate the company, but other factors come into play that almost force your hand in considering a career change.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Job Satisfaction Is in the Tank&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The company you work for may face structural changes, the need for rebranding, or new management. And the job you once loved now becomes a source of stress and anxiety. Job satisfaction can go from fab to drab in a hurry, changing everything you know about your role, responsibilities, or place in the company.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Layoffs or Terminations Are Eminent&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you recognize that your company ship is about to go down, you absolutely have the right and responsibility to make personal career changes. Layoffs and mass terminations are more common as major employers look to cut costs and streamline structures. Company buyouts bring mass changes, as well, which is what I faced when my department was eliminated suddenly. If you suspect similar changes are coming for you, start looking for a better path with a growing company or emerging industry that promises growth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Dissolution of Opportunities&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After investing years with a company and climbing your way to the top, you might eventually arrive at a plateau. The job is no longer challenging. There are no additional opportunities that appeal to you. And you see a dead end instead of growth and learning. It\u2019s time for a career change so you can chart a new path with a brand or company that offers a host of new opportunities. Or you can take and apply what you\u2019ve learned and start your own company as an entrepreneur.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Start Taking Steps to Change Career Gears&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If any of the aforementioned reasons are inspiring you to consider a career shift, these are the steps and insights to start taking action. It can be scary, especially if you\u2019re venturing into something entirely new. But methodical and deliberate decisions now can make it easier for you to spot the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/resume.io\/blog\/how-to-change-careers-later-in-life\"&gt;best-fit new opportunities&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Self-Assessment to Prepare for a Career Change&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start by getting honest with yourself in a self-assessment process. Sit down and think critically about your skills, knowledge, and potential. Create deal-breaker lists of must-have elements in your new career trajectory, along with dreamy, nice-to-haves. Don\u2019t discount soft skills, transferable skills, and experience that might make you a perfect hire in a new position. And be mindful of any weaknesses or areas of improvement that might be a roadblock to overcome before starting a new career.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Choosing a New Path&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With your self-assessment lists in mind, start doing some research online in various industries and niches. Check the job boards and see what different positions are offering and requiring. Visit company websites and read through industry blogs to familiarize yourself with emerging topics. Be keen to search for those areas that interest you specifically. Remember, you\u2019re looking for a NEW path and not trading one terrible experience for another. See what\u2019s out there and look to match up opportunities with your self-assessment list of skills and must-have career opportunities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sharpening New Skills for a Career Change&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/22-podcasts-influencers-thought-leaders-you-should-be-following-for-improving-leadership\/\"&gt;your research online&lt;\/a&gt;, you might start to notice requirements for jobs that sound appealing that you don\u2019t necessarily have. The next contemplation step is to explore what you need to do to sharpen those skills and fill some of those requirement gaps. Maybe you need to renew a lapsed insurance license or explore online certifications, for example. Other skills you\u2019ll want to sharpen include interviewing. Chances are, you haven\u2019t interviewed in a while. And many of today\u2019s recruiters and hiring managers follow a series of onboarding application and interview processes, including video interviews. Start practicing those potential conversations now, describing your experiences, asking great questions, and creating a vetting process for you to decide if the roles are good fits for your new career.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Creating a Full-Proof Safety Net&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes changing career gears so scary is the unknown and financial aspects. No one wants to jump ship and start something new without knowing for sure that the career change still allows you to pay your bills and meet your financial needs. So, at this stage in the process, create a safety net for yourself. Explore your financial situation now and identify what you need to make to maintain and keep your current lifestyle. Then create another list of benefits and job perks that you need to justify making the change. Assess your nest egg of savings and know how long you can wait to experience a boost in income, too. For some people changing gears, it may be necessary to explore side hustles or part-time work to sustain during unemployed stints. Be mindful of making ends meet in any timeline.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Be Forgiving and Flexible with Yourself&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s important, as you explore your options for new jobs online, to keep an open mind. Be flexible where you can, especially when deciding whether to even apply to a company. And be forgiving with yourself to step into unknown territory and find out what isn\u2019t a good fit opportunity. It can be challenging and overwhelming if you feel you can\u2019t find the \u201cperfect\u201d role. It doesn\u2019t mean a career change isn\u2019t in order. It just means you might have to consider other options or negotiate on some of your preferences to get a foot in the door. And don\u2019t be too proud to seek professional advice from a career coach, mentor, or recruiter. You can learn so much about the current workforce landscape from pros who have experience navigating it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Most Popular Fields for Those Looking for a Career Change&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the official to-do lists, self-assessments, and hard decisions behind you, you can get inspired and have some fun seeing all the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.theladders.com\/career-advice\/the-15-best-jobs-for-a-midlife-career-change-and-how-to-make-the-change\"&gt;different career paths&lt;\/a&gt; out there.
