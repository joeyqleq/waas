He&amp;#8217;s full of great advice, insight, and tips for bloggers and marketers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve been working on strategies for the blogs I work on and one of the points that finds its way to the top of these sessions is discussion &amp;#8211; comments, tweets, likes, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question is always, &amp;#8220;How do we get more interaction with readers, consumers, and passersby?&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Blogging Agreement and Argument&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the ways (and I think there are multiple) to increase conversation about your blog posts is to disagree with others. Adam Singer included this on his post &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/thefuturebuzz.com\/2009\/02\/16\/blog-post-ideas-generate-buzz\/\"&gt;45 Blog Post Ideas That Always Generate Buzz&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.  Write &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/thefuturebuzz.com\/2008\/11\/17\/marketing-lessons-learn-from-religion\/\"&gt;something counter&lt;\/a&gt; to what the rest of the world thinks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The difficult part of this strategy is that it&amp;#8217;s hard for companies to accept the fact that they have to make some people angry by not agreeing with them (not by hurting or misleading them &amp;#8211; disagreeing with them).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the trick is to find the right people to agree with and to disagree with. Be prepared to make valid points and be prepared for some backlash.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the agreement\/argument strategy on is a tough task. It requires a\u00a0delicate\u00a0balance so your company maintains integrity and vision.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key points to think about when starting this strategy:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose polarizing topics&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick a side and stand strong (choose carefully)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get dragged in too far&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Polarizing Topics&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every industry will have topics that are polarizing. People like to draw lines in the sand on certain issues. Your job as a blogger will be to find the topics in your industry and write a blog post that catches the attention of both sides of the argument.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And be sure to always have conversion in the back of your mind. Make sure the topic and the side you choose (see below) can lead customers to eventually purchase.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Picking Sides&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the argument approach to blogging is difficult. It takes guts and it takes a sharp mind. Once you have a topic picked there comes the decision of picking sides. Realize your goal is to make 50% of readers cheer you on in support while the other 50% bash you into the dirt. Pick the side that best aligns with your brand and image. This is a crucial step that needs to be taken every time before writing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Leaving Arguments&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When arguments start there needs to be a time when you know to leave certain aspects alone and simply walk away. Writing argumentative blog posts will bring in a few readers that are only there for the sake of arguing. Know when to walk away. Realize it&amp;#8217;s not worth the effort to argue with every single person. Submit your points. Let readers take sides. Participate in the open and honest\u00a0discussion, but know when to walk away.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a blog post that caused discussion over two points of an argument?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How does that post rate as far as comments?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In general my posts on Country Music Life don&amp;#8217;t get too many comments, hence the topic for this post. There are on occasion a few that get some comments though. Here is one of those:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/countrymusiclife.com\/sara-evans-stronger\/\"&gt;Sarah Evans is A Little Bit Stronger&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sara Evans became somewhat of a controversial figure in country music a few years ago when her divorce\u00a0proceedings\u00a0played out in \u00a0the public eye. Some fans felt the way Sara handled the situation was inappropriate especially regarding her kids.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t really take a side in the post I wrote. I simply talked about her new music, which I enjoy. I guess that&amp;#8217;s kind of picking the Sara&amp;#8217;s side on the issue. Some in the comments felt a boycott of her music was necessary. Others came to Sara&amp;#8217;s defense.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that leads to comments. My own little version of course.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can do much better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pedrosimoes7\/3717536433\/\"&gt;Wise Men Discussion&lt;\/a&gt; image courtesy of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pedrosimoes7\/3717536433\/\"&gt;pedrosimones7&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;For blogging to be successful on the level of discussion there needs to be some argument in the points you make.
