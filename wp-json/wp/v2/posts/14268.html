But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is Web3 platforms have their own ecosystems, utilizing cryptocurrency to reward users for certain actions, in some cases, letting them create their own NFTs to sell as digital tokens. As you may know, crypto and NFTs are huge buzzwords right now.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, are Web3 platforms worth adding to your marketing mix?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Do You Have The Bandwidth?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just as it\u2019s necessary to create a strategy for platforms like LinkedIn or YouTube, you must be able to develop a strategy for Web3 platforms to be effective.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Steemit (Medium alternative), Odysee (YouTube alternative), Rumble (another YouTube alternative), or otherwise. If you want to do well on any new platform, you must be willing to study its history and esthetic, learn best practices, and deliver content that\u2019s matched to the platform.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To an extent, you can take the content you already have and move it over to another platform (especially on video sharing sites), but that still requires resources, and without a clear understanding of the average user on the platform, merely placing your content in another context may not do much for your marketing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line \u2013 do you have the resources and time to dedicate to another platform, and if so, how many? Half an hour here, 25 minutes there adds up much quicker than you might think, and if you\u2019re maintaining a presence on multiple channels already, you know well the time and energy required.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As much as omnichannel marketing is the default these days, trying to keep up with every platform, at the rate they\u2019re popping up, is going to prove challenging at best.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Does it Fit with Your Brand?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It may not make sense for certain brands and companies to create a presence on Web3 platforms, especially those who\u2019ve taken an aggressive stance and bias towards the mainstream narrative in the last few years. For instance, Facebook building a presence on Rumble would seem incongruent, and even backwards.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn\u2019t to say that all Web3 platforms are dedicated exclusively to free speech and oddball conspiratorial discussion. Whether it\u2019s D.Tube or HIVE.blog, the platforms generally aren\u2019t as weird as they might sound!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if your company isn\u2019t perceived well by the demographic utilizing said platforms, there would be virtually no benefit in trying to reach an audience that fundamentally holds different values than you do. Ideally, you would have values that match up with the user base, or at least have a neutral stance that lets you interact in a meaningful way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we must all accept that we\u2019re headed into the age of Web3. Even Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have new blockchain developments they\u2019ve already deployed, or are in the process of developing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These may not be Web3 by the strictest of definitions (none of the major social networks are decentralized), but it\u2019s clear that they will be incorporating cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other functionalities into their technologies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ready or not, the time to begin studying up on Web3 is now.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Whether it\u2019s on the DeSo, STEEM, or HIVE blockchains, Web3 social networking platforms are quietly exploding.
