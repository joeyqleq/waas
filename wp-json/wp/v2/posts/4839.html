Here is a way to feel part of something.&lt;\/figcaption&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being an entrepreneur is great on a lot of levels. From the outside, I always envied the people that owned their own business. Sure, they seemed to have a lot of stress, but the successful entrepreneurs that I knew seemed to thrive on making decisions and living by how well their business provided a product or service to customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I have my own business I do think that being an entrepreneur is great. It&amp;#8217;s all I ever wanted to do and I&amp;#8217;m very happy with how things have gone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Entrepreneur Depression&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I do notice that for some entrepreneurs that it&amp;#8217;s not all roses and candy. I definitely have a few times when I&amp;#8217;m frustrated with the ways things are going. You get that in all aspects of life and with every job (I would assume). It&amp;#8217;s for sure something that happens to entrepreneurs. The stress levels can get high and there can be really high highs, but also some low lows.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite blogs that I try to read whenever there is a new post is &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.spring.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;PsyBlog&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The founder of the blog scours the psychology journals looking for interesting cases and studies. He puts them together to create very interesting and very useful posts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of his recent posts was on depression &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.spring.org.uk\/2014\/09\/depression-alleviated-by-feeling-connected-to-a-group.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Depression Alleviated By Feeling Connected To A Group&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key in the finding was not just that it&amp;#8217;s important to be in a group, but to feel part of that group or identifying with that group. The author said it was partially about referring to whatever group you join as &amp;#8220;us&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; instead of referring to the group as &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas for local groups you can join.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Sports League&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love to play golf. If you&amp;#8217;ve read a few of the posts here on the blog in the past you probably noticed that. So for me a great sports league to join is a golf league. I joined one a couple years ago. I didn&amp;#8217;t know anyone in the league and was paired up with a team. The experience was great and I always looked forward to it every week during the summer.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had to leave the league the next two years due to moving, but will be back again next summer probably with an entirely new team. It&amp;#8217;s a chance to meet new people both on the team and in the league.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can join any league for any sport. Most communities have them and even if you&amp;#8217;re a little rusty you can usually find a group that will help you get back up to speed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These leagues are mostly about the camaraderie\u00a0anyway instead of the sport.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Games League&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are games leagues around most communities too. They&amp;#8217;re similar to sports leagues &amp;#8211; things like darts, bean bag toss and lots of other fun activities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Professionals Group&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my community it&amp;#8217;s called the Young Professionals and also the Chamber of Commerce. But there are lots of other groups with different niches. Most allow you to come to a meeting or two to see what it&amp;#8217;s like and if you get a good feeling you can join and start getting involved and being part of something.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Fitness Class&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have friends that do this. Some people I would have never thought would like fitness have joined things like CrossFit and Hot Yoga. There are all kinds of things. There is something about a hard workout that brings people together. Plus you get in great shape while being part of a group.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Band&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This could probably go in the last catch-all category here, but I know a few people that are in bands or music groups that get together and play. I think it&amp;#8217;s cool and there always seems to be a real feeling of belonging when you are in a band or even if you get together with a couple people or even just one person to play tunes and kick around a bit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Lots Of Other Options&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are countless things you can join in your community. I have a few friends\u00a0that I&amp;#8217;m going to get together this fall for hunting season. You could have people that you walk with or bike with each week. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s crafts. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s even a local group that competes in trivia groups.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My now-wife and I went to a dance class put on by a local group. I can&amp;#8217;t remember their name, but it was fun and I could see why people would want to join and be part of something.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think you could even start something of your own. That&amp;#8217;s probably if you know what you want, which is great. But if you don&amp;#8217;t have an idea of what you would like then try a few things. You don&amp;#8217;t have to love the first thing or even the first few things. You only need to find one thing that trips your trigger and you&amp;#8217;ll be likely to enjoy that group, which will lead to that feeling of belonging.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Introverts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#8217;re an introvert like me then you&amp;#8217;ve probably come up with excuses on why you can&amp;#8217;t join any of these groups.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;ve struggled with that too in the past, but found a way around it. Read this &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/tip-introverts-networking-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;post&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being part of a group is a great way to feel good no matter what you&amp;#8217;re doing. But if you&amp;#8217;re an entrepreneur and you&amp;#8217;re feeling isolated due to the nature of your work then joining a group could be crucial to avoiding depression and even sadness on a less severe level. Hopefully the ideas above can spark an idea or two for something you can do to get out and be part of a group.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It can lead to better feelings for you, which means you&amp;#8217;ll be happier and your business will probably be better off as a result. And that usually makes any business owner happy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, it&amp;#8217;s not enough to just\u00a0&lt;em&gt;join&lt;\/em&gt; a group. You need to become part of it to really see\u00a0the benefits.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship can be a lonely place.
