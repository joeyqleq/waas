It&amp;#8217;s more about trying new things because if you stand still in life you&amp;#8217;re going to get passed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my life, there have definitely been times when I&amp;#8217;ve worried about what other people would think. I don&amp;#8217;t know what it is, but we have a culture that kind of focuses on the things people don&amp;#8217;t do well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, when a favorite music act tries something a little different on an album. It comes out and it&amp;#8217;s not what fans expect or want. The album is panned and the act might have a bad reputation for the rest of their career.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That happens throughout life and it seems that as we get older we get more fearful of trying new things for fear of failure and ridicule.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve tried to fight those fears in my life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Blogging&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I started blogging for the first time. I had no idea what I was doing. I broke a lot of unwritten rules in the blogging world. I read a lot of blogs and figured I could do it, but I had no idea what I was doing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t really tell a lot of people about it for fear that they would make fun of what I was trying to do. In fact, I had no idea what I was trying to do. I was just experimenting with something that I had some interest in and that seemed to be popular with others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward a few years and now blogging is my life&amp;#8217;s work. Well, it&amp;#8217;s my life&amp;#8217;s work up to this point. We have Ghost Blog Writers, which I love having and love managing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s save to say that blogging as an experiment has panned out so far.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Podcasting And Video&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m experimenting with podcasting. My wife and I will be putting out commentary on business, design, content and what it&amp;#8217;s like to both work from home and to have a husband and wife with their own small businesses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t really have any expectations, but we&amp;#8217;re trying it. We&amp;#8217;ll probably be horrible starting out, but I&amp;#8217;m excited to see where it could go and what opportunity it could bring.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing might come of it, but that would be okay too. It&amp;#8217;s just an experiment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I also started filming my deer hunts. This year I&amp;#8217;m going to get back into doing that regularly again. I hope it turns out to be worthwhile. So far it&amp;#8217;s just a hobby and I&amp;#8217;m fine with it being that way. It&amp;#8217;s another experiment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Expectations&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s fine to go into experimenting with expectations. But as an example, a friend of mine commented on my early blogging days by asking, &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re blogging? What good can come of that? What&amp;#8217;s in it for you?&amp;#8221;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He was talking about money. I really had no idea if money would come of it. I was just trying something.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I think that if you&amp;#8217;re good at something and if you pay attention to what people need then you can figure out the money side of things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see what podcasting and video bring, but right now I have no expectation of money. There are greater rewards in life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All I know is that experimenting in life and in business have worked out well for me so far. I plan to keep trying little things here and there in my spare time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I think you could benefit as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m trying a few new things.
