Eventually he started prank calling into radio stations. He would pretend to be different people.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually he was calling into 20+ stations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He never got paid, but he&amp;#8217;d ask the hosts to mention his upcoming show in the area.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around 2000, he got a call from Jeff Foxworthy with an invite to join him on a new tour. There wasn&amp;#8217;t much money in it. I think Larry had to pay his own airfare.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But he did it. The tour and DVD that followed introduced Larry to a huge new audience. And from there he&amp;#8217;s been one of the most successful comedians in the last couple decades.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Calling into radio stations as a prank caller is not a traditional way to market yourself or a business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Accepting an opening slot on a tour for negative money doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like a smart idea. But it was an opportunity that could lead to something big in the long-term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re struggling with the more traditional and common forms of marketing for your company then maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to try something a little different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Go Through Each Filter&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has filters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People in high positions have filters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/sivers.org\/gofilt\"&gt;wrote&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A filter in this context is something or someone that filters information, opportunity, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say the person that makes the decision to use your software is the VP of Marketing. That person is busy. They don&amp;#8217;t have time to review every opportunity available.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They have filters. They probably have actual filters in their email inbox that filters out promotions and outreach emails. They know they might miss a good opportunity now and then, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it because they just don&amp;#8217;t have time to filter through everything.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And they also probably have employees that help to filter information.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s your opportunity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could even start by forming a relationship with an intern. Then the manager. Working your way to the VP.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do things like providing information or offering advice that helps the intern do their job. When they do a good job their manager will notice. Your name will probably come up. Then you can build trust with the manager.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s difficult to jump straight to the top to sell. Going through the filters is long-term, but effective if you build it into your normal sales process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Event Effort&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago I went to this fund raiser event in a nearby town. I was just curious. I wasn&amp;#8217;t really a wanted guest or anything like that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wanted guests were business leaders from around the area. The city was looking to raise a final chunk of money for a project. So they had all the business leaders there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this event the organizers needed various designs. Posters, handouts, signs, etc. All kinds of things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A local designer offered her services. She did a great job. And she was allowed to promote herself with her logo. Kind of a &amp;#8220;Designed by&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; note. Nothing crazy, but the business leaders could see it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She was there too. Getting to meet all these business leaders, her target market.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where do your target customers gather?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conferences?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry events?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How can you help those event organizers in return for a little exposure?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll cost you time. Maybe free access and use of your software.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the payoff can be great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Snippet Offers&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can you take a piece of your software, maybe even a really small piece, and give it away for free or for a small price?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your full software package might cost quite a bit to your target customer. At least when they first realize that you exist and they don&amp;#8217;t know the value it offers. That can be a large barrier.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But what if you had another type of product to offer? Some valuable, but at a much lower price.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say you sell dentist office CRM software. It has a monthly or annual fee. It&amp;#8217;s a big change for a dentist office to change to your software.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But many dentists need websites. Nothing crazy, but nice.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could create a website template for WordPress. A nice one. And sell it for a one-time fee of a hundred bucks or so.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You lower the barrier to entry. You start doing business with your target customers. You earn trust. And that makes it easier for them to buy your big product.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Influencer Connections&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who influences your target customers? Who do they work with everyday? Who might refer them to vendors?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say you have a podcasting software. Your customers are podcasters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Podcasters often have guests. They spend a lot of time communicating with guests. Odds are good that those guests talk about things they&amp;#8217;re using.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identify 20 or so frequent guests on podcasts. People that are on podcasts all the time. People that might also have their own podcast.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Send them your software for free. Don&amp;#8217;t ask for anything in return. Show them how to use it. Set it up for them. Make it really easy for them to start using it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now if this person is on guest on a podcast and your software really has helped them they will likely mention you to other podcasters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Referral Incentives&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Referral incentives can be tricky, but they can be really effective.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PayPal used to offer users cold hard cash for referring others. When you refer someone you&amp;#8217;d get money added to your PayPal account.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dropbox did the same. Refer someone and you get more space on your account.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is your software tiered?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Offer users higher levels for referrals. You already know they like your product. They probably want more of it. Give them a way to do it without paying you money.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;6. Partner Programs&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that there are complementary software products to your own.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Find about 5-10 of those.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not ones that compete with you. Ones that your target customer uses for another task they need.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Go to these companies and tell them that you are willing to give them a unique discount to their customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Companies are always looking for ways to help their customers. That can include referrals to other products. And it&amp;#8217;s even more appealing if they can offer a discount.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;7. Free Tool&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This one has been fairly popular with SaaS companies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HubSpot has a variety of ways that they promote their software.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I remember one day vividly. My boss came to me with a printout. The printout was the company&amp;#8217;s website grade via HubSpot Website Grader.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HubSpot had keyed in on a need or want of business owners. The need to see how their website stacked up.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HubSpot didn&amp;#8217;t sell the grading service. They created the tool and let people use it for free. All as a way to get exposure and attention from their target customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What do your target customers want to know about their business or about their lives?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What tool can you create to help answer those questions?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guerrilla marketing is all about trying something a little different. Something that others aren&amp;#8217;t doing. You can still do the traditional things like advertising and inbound marketing. Everything in marketing still takes work.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes the guerrilla tactics can set you apart. And it can get you exposure and attention to help you reach a tipping point in your business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Looking to boost sales for your SaaS?
