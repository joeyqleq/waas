But no matter which category you fall into, you can\u2019t escape life\u2019s lessons.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s why tuning into life and its lessons is crucial to your development.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Why Identify the Lesson?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Until we know what life is trying to show us, there\u2019s nothing we can do in response to change or better our circumstances.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve all experienced pain, whether physical, emotional, or psychological. And most would agree that no matter the category, prolonged pain is the most uncomfortable and undesirable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The longer we stay in a lesson, the more pain we can expect to experience. Pain is relative, sure, but the unwillingness to face the truth for long periods can mean sacrificing joy in the immediate and having to face the fear repeatedly long-term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;When Problems Grow into Monsters&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t make a mountain out of a molehill\u201d is an idiom that reportedly stems from the 16th century. The modern equivalent is \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t cry over spilled milk.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s the problem with challenges we refuse to face \u2013 they always have a way of cropping up again, at the least opportune moment. By that time, a \u201cmolehill\u201d issue can sometimes appear as an insurmountable \u201cmountain.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether it\u2019s talking to the opposite sex, asking for what you need in a relationship, public speaking, making sales presentations, or anything else you might be making a mountain out of \u2013 if you don\u2019t face the lesson early, it can grow into a metaphorical monster you don\u2019t feel you can overcome.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What is Life Trying to Show You Now?&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For entrepreneurs and ambitious types, nothing is worse than the feeling of being stuck. After all, we believe ourselves to be smarter than that, able to problem-solve any setbacks and overcome any circumstances life throws our way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we can\u2019t progress beyond where we are without dealing with the lesson in front of us. And, of course, we can\u2019t deal with the lesson in front of us without knowing what it is we\u2019re supposed to be learning.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our progress can grind to a halt and at times it may even seem as though our projects or businesses are shrinking when they should be growing. We can easily end up in a frustrating downward spiral, especially if we try to solve the problem with blunt force.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is why business is the ultimate personal development tool. We need to be willing to face whatever is there to get to the next level. And whatever is there can appear very scary, especially if we\u2019ve left it to fester for a while.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what lesson you\u2019re supposed to be learning now\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stop. Become present. Ask the Universe for assistance. Notice what\u2019s showing up in your world. Identify themes and commonalities. Be willing to face the uncomfortable. Write down what comes to you and journal about it. Don\u2019t try to rush the process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is it you\u2019re not owning up to, and what can you do about it? The expansion of your world hinges on your willingness to face lessons head-on. Become the kind of person that can dance with the monster.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;When the student is ready, the teacher will appear, and life always tries to show us something.
