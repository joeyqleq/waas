We get these little urges and ideas and our minds run wild.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But you can have all the dreams you want, but in the end you&amp;#8217;ll be what you do every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Changing Jobs And Starting Businesses&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I struggled with this one for a bit in a few different ways.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had a great job that I liked, but I also had a few ideas for different businesses. One ended up being Ghost Blog Writers, but it started out really as nothing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had been reading blogs. I figured I could do one, but never got started. Then one day I realized that if I wanted to be a blogger I just had to start and then keep doing it. I figured I&amp;#8217;d get there eventually; learn along the way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got asked to blog for a company and then another and it grew from there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then the next time I was growing the business on the side and reached a point where I had to make a choice. Keep doing that or leave my job and become a real business owner full-time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had to become what I wanted to be.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Getting Away From Writing&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t do any writing for clients at GBW anymore. A few years ago I had to make that jump. I wanted to be a business owner. Blogging is still something I enjoy doing, but I wanted to ultimately be a business owner.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I had to make the step of becoming what I did every day. I had to move away from being a blogger and a writer and hire great people to do that instead and move on to the next stage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;New Challenges&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#8217;s also getting to the point where I am what I do every day. Right now that&amp;#8217;s really the role of account manager. And it&amp;#8217;s been great, but now it&amp;#8217;s time to move on again.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be a business owner. I want the business to run on its own without me. So I&amp;#8217;ll have to make a step where I am what I do every day and become something other than an account manager.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Hobbies&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think we all also have hobbies that we want to do as well. We don&amp;#8217;t have time for everything, but we do have time for a few things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if you really want to get good at something you have to do it every day. For me that&amp;#8217;s golf. And I notice it and don&amp;#8217;t do as well as I should.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I practice even if it&amp;#8217;s just practice swings or holding a club or putting. It helps.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I follow Hank Haney and he talks about it all the time. He had a TV show where he helped celebrities become better golfers and he worked with Michael Phelps. Michael said that with swimming if he misses a day of practice it takes him like two days to get back to where he was.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think Ben Hogan said the same thing about golf practice.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are what we do every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Final Thought&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to become something you have to adjust what you do every day. You have to dedicate time to something if you want it to happen. It won&amp;#8217;t just happen and I think we all know that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But getting started is the first step. That&amp;#8217;s a difficult step, but it&amp;#8217;s actually easier than doing something every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you want to do or become you have to commit to doing it every day or it won&amp;#8217;t happen. If it&amp;#8217;s business, personal or whatever &amp;#8211; commit and do it every day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;What do you want to be?
