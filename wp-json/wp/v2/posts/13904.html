With your boss? With your coworkers? With things overall and about the future of the organization?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons to feel frustrated. Some are out of your control. But sometimes a frustration results from an improper expectation. Of ourselves, but also of others. Or of the organization. That last one can be tricky because the organization can often take blame when really it&amp;#8217;s the people in charge.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, anytime you see a frustration it can be good to look at what your expectation is regarding the situation. This can possibly lead to a resolution that you control.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. You Set Unrealistic Goals and Fail To Meet Them&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Frustration could be coming by you feeling that you&amp;#8217;re not getting as far along as you wish. It could be that you&amp;#8217;re creating unrealistic goals for yourself for your career. You want to be a VP by age 30. You want to make a certain salary by age 40. All kinds of things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have these been accomplished before at your place of work? Does your personal life allow for the type of time and energy commitment required to achieve your goals?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not meeting goals it could be easy to find blame in others. But often it can be in our own expectations. Expectations that aren&amp;#8217;t realistic for our situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Others &amp;#8220;Disappoint&amp;#8221; You&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you ask someone to help you with something. They&amp;#8217;re late. They&amp;#8217;re not following your processes exactly as you wish. They&amp;#8217;re not doing things the same as you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This can all lead to disappointment. You perhaps have found a way that works for you. You want others to follow the same path so that it leads to the same result. But that&amp;#8217;s not always reality for every situation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It can lead to a lot of disappointment. If you sense this happening look at your expectations of others. They may be too high, too quick or any number of things that can lead to discourse.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s good to expect a lot of others. It&amp;#8217;s good to build others up. But not to the point of negativity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. You Isolate From Coworkers&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are you sensing that you&amp;#8217;re isolating from coworkers? It could be that you&amp;#8217;re looking to avoid being disappointed. You feel that you&amp;#8217;re more successful if you work on projects alone. At least then you know that the blame can lay with you if something doesn&amp;#8217;t go correctly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This could be the result of you focusing on the negative with others. And not the positive ways that others contribute to the company.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It could really be a situation that isn&amp;#8217;t good. But at least take a little time to assess what your expectations are of others. And if you&amp;#8217;re overlooking the positives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Look For The Good In Others&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a general theme that&amp;#8217;s good to have in life. Looking for the good in others. You can typically find whatever you&amp;#8217;re looking for in life. Good. Bad. All kinds of things. So try to determine where your focus is. If you&amp;#8217;re emphasizing the negative then your expectations are probably out of line.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Be Flexible In Your Plans&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a million right answers to just about any question. You do something one way. It works. You feel that others should do it the same way. At work. In your personal life. But you have to be open and flexible to the possibility that there are multiple correct answers to a number of situations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Try to find the way that will work for the situation. Work with coworkers on compromises. Better teamwork often leads to success. Not necessarily forcing others to conform.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re sensing frustration with your work it may be time to look for alternatives. But it&amp;#8217;s at least worth exploring your expectations. For yourself and for others. It could be a situation that can be changed for the good by resetting your expectations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Many of life&amp;#8217;s frustrations are often caused by our expectations.
