There are often many different things to deal with and sometimes that number really goes up especially if you&amp;#8217;re dealing with different clients, different questions, employees, and all kinds of other tasks.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#8217;re at home and you want to make sure you&amp;#8217;re there for your family and the things the family is going through together. And maybe you have something you really care about like a hobby and maybe with everything going on you&amp;#8217;re struggling with that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like a small thing, but my favorite hobby is golf. And if I&amp;#8217;m struggling with that and can&amp;#8217;t figure it out it&amp;#8217;s frustrating. It&amp;#8217;s certainly not the end of the world, but it&amp;#8217;s one more thing weighing on your mind.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I go through weeks like this. It happens especially if I have a lot of tasks or events when I&amp;#8217;m around people all the time. As an introvert, that drains me. It takes my energy and I have to have some downtime to get that energy back.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that kind of brings us to the topic of dealing with brain drain and getting your brain back functioning.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I try to do.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Naps And More Sleep&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Usually when we&amp;#8217;re busy we get\u00a0&lt;em&gt;less&lt;\/em&gt; sleep.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s probably the worst thing to do and I learned this early on when I started working on Ghost Blog Writers full-time. I would try to pull all nighters and work all the time and the work suffered.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#8217;ve learned that when I&amp;#8217;m feeling drained it&amp;#8217;s best to put things aside. In just about all cases things can wait. It&amp;#8217;s true, but often we put our own deadlines on things when we don&amp;#8217;t really need to.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take a step back and get some much needed sleep. Let your brain catch up and get more sleep than you might think you need with naps.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think TV is good here. I like reading because it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to sap your brain by adding on one more thing, but it also seems better for your brain that staring at the TV for a few hours. I just about always get more energy from reading whether it&amp;#8217;s reading the newspaper or a novel or a biography.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like reading certain tops of news. I&amp;#8217;m more about stories and really the feel good stories. I subscribe to this rural paper in our area and they always have some great stories. I don&amp;#8217;t pay attention to the news quite as much, but I like the stories and it seems to help get my mind off many things and on one thing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Walks&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Walking is a good time to reflect for me. It&amp;#8217;s almost like a meditation. I try not to think about all the things going on, but it happens and I try to let those thoughts pass while focusing on what&amp;#8217;s going on around me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, it seems to add energy to my brain and my body.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;More Hobby Time&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that I like golf. When my game&amp;#8217;s not going well it&amp;#8217;s frustrating and tough, but it&amp;#8217;s still nice to focus and figure out what&amp;#8217;s going on. And with practice you do get better. You might have a few steps back, but usually you can get back to where you were and even better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And all that practice can put your brain on one thing again and with that you&amp;#8217;re easing all the many thoughts going on and it seems to add energy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thought&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure there are lots of ways you can ease the tension on your brain with all the things going on. When you&amp;#8217;re feeling brain drained you could meditate or cook or do whatever it is that gets your brain better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that what works is removing yourself from all the thoughts you don&amp;#8217;t necessarily want for a while and focusing on one thing that makes you pretty happy. Maybe going to your child&amp;#8217;s ball game and paying attention to that or calling an old friend and catching up on their life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is for you it&amp;#8217;s important to do something to ease the brain drain, but if you push through you likely won&amp;#8217;t come out of it and your work and your personal life will suffer.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;This week has been hectic, but this post is not about wallowing in sorrow about how difficult life is.
