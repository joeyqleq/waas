One &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.spring.org.uk\/2014\/10\/brain-scans-reveal-why-up-to-one-in-six-people-get-sad-in-winter.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;study&lt;\/a&gt; found that nearly 10% of people in New Hampshire suffer from sadness during winter compared to only about 2% in Florida.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other day I went to the store to get a shovel in preparation for winter here in Wisconsin. The forecast has been calling for chances of the first winter flurries here in our part of the world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy doing a lot of things outside during the warm months especially golfing. So it&amp;#8217;s always a little sad to see the sun disappear more as the days move into winter, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve in the category of people that get sad.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also kind of found things to look forward to and to enjoy during the cold months of the year. Here are some of my favorite reasons to love Wisconsin Winters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Better Sleep&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My body runs hot throughout the year. I don&amp;#8217;t really sleep well when the temperature in the room is over 70 degrees. It&amp;#8217;s harder to keep the temp down in the summertime so I look forward to winter because the temps are easy to keep low. I can sleep sound and usually sleep through the entire night. I always say you can only take off so many covers and clothes, but if you&amp;#8217;re a little chilly you can always add a layer.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Crackling Wood Fires&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always been a tradition throughout my life to enjoy wood fireplaces. My family had one growing up and my grandparents always had one. More people use the more practical gas fireplaces today, but I still can find a few places to enjoy the crackling of a wood fire in the fireplace. There is just something soothing about it. I could grab a book or article and read for hours in a chair by the fire.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. No Bugs&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The summer isn&amp;#8217;t too bad here in Wisconsin, but on muggy days near water and where there is a lack of birds you&amp;#8217;ll usually find a flurry of flies, gnats and mosquitoes. They&amp;#8217;re tolerable, but they can really put a downer on your day. For example, you might have to swat away gnats during a round of golf.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is no need to worry in the wintertime, though. The bugs are all dead.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. A Rush Of Fresh Air&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever breathed in zero degree air? It&amp;#8217;s quite the experience. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t recommend staying outdoors for too long when the temps get low, but it really puts a rush through your body to take a breath when it&amp;#8217;s so cold that you feel it in your lungs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Family Time&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The holidays are coming up here in most parts of the world. It&amp;#8217;s a time to spend with family and even though it&amp;#8217;s only a correlation with the cold months it&amp;#8217;s still always a reminder that when the weather turns cold that time to spend with family is coming along shortly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;6. Time In The Woods&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hunting season in Wisconsin. And yes we&amp;#8217;re after the great animal, the whitetail deer, but it&amp;#8217;s really about enjoying time in the woods. There are usually at least a few days where you&amp;#8217;ll get some snow on the ground and there is nothing like spending a few hours in the woods when there is snow on the ground. Everything that moves is visible. You can see forever and you&amp;#8217;ll see all kinds of wildlife. It shows you how wonderful nature can be.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;7. Ice Fishing&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I only ice fish one time each year, but it&amp;#8217;s a great weekend. A collection\u00a0buddies from high school, college and today all get together to have a fun weekend. When we get together it&amp;#8217;s like we just saw each other yesterday even though it had been a year. It&amp;#8217;s a neat thing and the ice fishing is fun too. We don&amp;#8217;t always catch fish, but when we do it&amp;#8217;s a nice little bonus.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;8. Cutting Down The Christmas Tree&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spending time with family is one I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned, but this is kind of an extension. It&amp;#8217;s a tradition in my family to cut down a tree from the tree farm each day after Thanksgiving. We don&amp;#8217;t go shopping. We go find a tree for everyone&amp;#8217;s home. It can be cold. It can be windy, but we&amp;#8217;re always out there finding the perfect tree for the house.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;9. Christmas Music&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m kind of a sap when it comes to holiday music. I enjoy this time of year when I can go back and listen to all the classics. I like the standards like\u00a0&lt;em&gt;White Christmas&lt;\/em&gt; by Bing Crosby and all those, but I really like country Christmas songs. I love the old ones and even the new ones. There are always new albums that the country artists put out. But I still like going back and hearing the ones from years past.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;10. Basketball Season&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t play as much as I used to, but I look back on my childhood and wintertime always meant basketball season. I loved it as a kid and I probably need to get back into it with an intramural came or something. At the very least I&amp;#8217;m going to try to make it to a few games at the University of Wisconsin &amp;#8211; Eau Claire this winter.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Final Thought&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are just a few reasons I love Wisconsin Winters. I still love in the springtime when the snow melts and I can get back on the golf course. But I don&amp;#8217;t see myself giving up those winter months although I say that now. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how I&amp;#8217;ll feel the first time I have to go out and shovel a foot of heavy snow and ice off the driveway and sidewalk.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin winters can be harsh.
