It looks like people are interested in the potential of how a blogging inititative can benefit a start up (or any company).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d take a few snippets and expand with my own thoughts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Startup Blogging&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The quotes are from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/msuster\"&gt;Mark Suster&lt;\/a&gt; and the article on &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\"&gt;Tech Crunch&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Blogging&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you care about accessing customers, reaching an audience, communicating your vision, influencing people in your industry, marketing your services or just plain engaging in a dialog with others in your industry a blog is a great way to achieve this.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/business-blogging-growth-2011\"&gt;More&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/lead-generation-blog\"&gt;and&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/starting-business-blog\"&gt;more&lt;\/a&gt; businesses are looking to blogging as a way to build their standing in an industry with the ultimate goal of increasing sales and revenue. Blogging creates a destination on your company website for your audience to find the information they need to successfully travel down the sales funnel and eventually make a purchase\u00a0preferably\u00a0from your company.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The content you create on your company blog will serve as an asset forever. The information you provide is something people are seeking when making decisions along the purchasing path.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your company is blogging consistently you&amp;#8217;re going to fall behind your competitors within the next few years. Somebody is going to provide answers for your target customers and if it&amp;#8217;s not you those people will find somewhere else to do business because thought leaders are emerging via blogging and people are\u00a0gravitating\u00a0to them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re still not convince think about where your sales leads come from. If website traffic is one of the sources you&amp;#8217;ll find it interesting that businesses that blog get &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/blog-traffic\"&gt;55% more visitors than non-blogging\u00a0businesses&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Topic&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re going to pump out regular content that is meaningful, you obviously need to blog about a topic in which you\u2019re knowledgeable, thoughtful and passionate. If you\u2019re not all three of these things in your industry then I guess you\u2019ve got a broader problem. Honestly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my biggest recommendation of \u201cwhat\u201d to blog is a series of articles that will be helpful to your community.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being\u00a0knowledgeable\u00a0about your industry should come fairly easy. If you&amp;#8217;ve been in business for a while you probably know more than you think. Share your insight with your audience and they&amp;#8217;ll come to appreciate your contributions to their lives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The common rule is to discuss what you know. Don&amp;#8217;t try to be anything you aren&amp;#8217;t. There are ways to figure out what your audience is looking for. Combine those needs with your knowledge and blogging from there gets easier.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The next tricky part is being consistent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found blogging consistently on a schedule benefits blogs. People like consistency. People like to get into a routine and that includes checking websites. If consistently publish blog posts &amp;#8211; monthly, weekly, or even daily &amp;#8211; you have a good chance of getting into your customers&amp;#8217; routines. That&amp;#8217;s a good thing in the blogging world. It builds trust, which is crucial for any thought leader in any industry.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Determine a consistency you can live with and maintain over the long term. Stick to the schedule while still maintaining a level of enjoyment and experimentation with your blog publishing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Guest Posting&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So once you have a blog, a voice and a small following \u2013 don\u2019t be shy about writing some guest posts for target blogs. Remember \u2013 for you that\u2019s likely not TC \u2013 it\u2019s the place your community hangs out.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guest posting is a great way to provide content to other bloggers in return for access to an expanded audience. It takes work to find blogs where your potential audience is spending time. You&amp;#8217;ll need to become a reader of blogs similar to yours. You might want to contribute a few comments to the blogs. You might want to read through the archives to understand what a specific blog is really about. From here you can determine what kind of blog post you can write for the guest post.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think of guest posting as a duet between singers. When artists from two different genres or even the same genre of music get together to record a hit duet they are each trying to tap into the attention of each other&amp;#8217;s audience. Guest blogging is really the same thing and the ultimate deciding factor to success if how good the content is.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;General Thoughts&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In general I&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.forbes.com\/deborahsweeney\/2011\/03\/31\/the-five-ws-of-business-blogging\/\"&gt;seeing an&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/03\/30\/small-business-blogs\/\"&gt;increasing&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.columbiatribune.com\/news\/2011\/mar\/19\/blogging-helps-extend-businesses-reach\/\"&gt;number&lt;\/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.chicagonow.com\/blogs\/todays-chicago-woman-jobs-money-opinion\/2011\/03\/brokers-are-you-blogging-for-business-you-should.html\"&gt;articles&lt;\/a&gt; and blog posts about the benefits of blogging. The benefits are there for the taking by individuals and businesses. With a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/starting-business-blog\"&gt;large percentage of businesses&lt;\/a&gt; expected to be blogging in the next few years it&amp;#8217;s not a matter of if your company should blog, it&amp;#8217;s a matter of how are your going to make your blog better than the competition.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few key ways:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consistency&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Answer the right questions&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Personality&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Write consistent posts to become part of people&amp;#8217;s routines. Find the questions your readers are asking and use your knowledge to answer via your blog. Allow your personality to enter your blog posts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a ton more in &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/03\/27\/why-startups-need-to-blog-and-what-to-talk-about\/\"&gt;the article&lt;\/a&gt;.
