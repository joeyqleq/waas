I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure I remember hearing it at just about all the jobs I&amp;#8217;ve had.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That goes back to working on the grounds crew at a golf course in high school to my first (and I guess only) job out of college.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#8217;re in business and are involved in marketing and sales then you&amp;#8217;ve probably heard this question as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if customers aren&amp;#8217;t asking it to you in person or on the phone they&amp;#8217;re probably asking it when they&amp;#8217;re looking through your website.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I thought we could get into some of the best answers you can give to the question,\u00a0&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Why should we hire you?&amp;#8221;&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Values &amp;amp; Goals&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every company is different in some ways. When they&amp;#8217;re bringing on new vendors and partners it&amp;#8217;s expected that there will be some time to adapt to each other.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, businesses know that they can train processes pretty easy and they can learn processes pretty easy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s\u00a0&lt;em&gt;not&lt;\/em&gt; easy to train are values and goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When businesses hire individuals for jobs they often want to make sure that the individual shares the same values as others at the company. They want to make sure that the individual&amp;#8217;s goals lineup with the company&amp;#8217;s goals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The reason this is important is that when you have value and goal alignment then your motivations will be to benefit yourself, your company and the company you&amp;#8217;re working with&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Research the companies you&amp;#8217;re pitching. Learn their values and goals. You can even ask them. Identify how you&amp;#8217;re in alignment on these and point this out in the sales process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Punctuality&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;George Washington was a huge &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.artofmanliness.com\/2012\/07\/16\/a-man-is-punctual-the-importance-of-being-on-time\/\"&gt;believer in punctuality&lt;\/a&gt;. He believed that being punctual was a wonderful way to show respect for others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I agree.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s going to be important that you can deliver great results for your business clients, but if you aren&amp;#8217;t reliable with being on time you&amp;#8217;ll drive them crazy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the sales process it&amp;#8217;s important to be punctual.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; When responding to emails don&amp;#8217;t take more than one business day to reply. When promising to provide something set a realistic timeline and don&amp;#8217;t be late with delivery.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Proof&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People generally don&amp;#8217;t like to be the first ones to do something. We like to\u00a0&lt;em&gt;think&lt;\/em&gt; that we want to be first, but I think we&amp;#8217;ve evolved to know that being first is dangerous.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It can work wonderfully when it goes well, but it can also be very dangerous.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Businesses don&amp;#8217;t like being first with something. They want to see proof that what you do will work. They also want to see proof that you can provide what you say you will.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s obviously difficult if you&amp;#8217;re a startup, but there are things you can do to show proof.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; You can offer a trial period of work to prove yourself. You can offer a money back guarantee. And if you have worked for some time then you want to put together a collection of case studies to show what you can do.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Passion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People are attracted to passion. You can usually tell when someone is passionate about something. It&amp;#8217;s all they talk about. It&amp;#8217;s all they think about. They would do it even if they weren&amp;#8217;t getting paid.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are you passionate about the service you provide to your clients? Really passionate?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t need to prove that you&amp;#8217;ll work 24\/7 for your prospective clients, but they usually do want to know that you&amp;#8217;ll be willing to go the extra distance to make things work.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Document your passion for your work. You can do this by creating a video where you discuss your love for your work. You can interview your team as well. Talk about the things that excite you about the business and the industry.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Cordiality&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I read the book by &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ghostblogwriters.com\/alex-spanos-lessons\"&gt;Alex Spanos&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He was very successful in the real estate business and many other businesses. He purchased the San Diego Chargers around 1984 and he vividly remembered a contract negotiation with a rookie named Mossy Cade.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is what happened. Something to this effect&amp;#8230;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cade walked into the room, dressed like a slob, sat back with his feet up on the table and made a demand for money.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spanos was so put back that he eventually traded Cade to Green Bay.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#8217;t matter that Cade was one of the most talented players in the draft that year. He wasn&amp;#8217;t cordial and that meant something to Alex Spanos.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cade flamed out in Green Bay.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Your mom was right. It&amp;#8217;s important to mind your manners. Treat people with respect and dignity. It goes a long way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;6. Communication&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How well can you communicate?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does your potential client fully understand what you can do for them?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you email, can they comprehend what you&amp;#8217;re saying, what you&amp;#8217;ll do and when you&amp;#8217;ll do it?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Communication skills are obviously important in many areas of life. They&amp;#8217;re important in business when it comes to selling yourself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Make your statements as clear as possible. Do more listening than talking. Listen to what your client is expressing. You&amp;#8217;ll learn more and you can then make your solution fit with their need.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;7. Team First&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Human nature is that we care about ourselves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s survival instinct.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But in a business sense you accomplish much more with a team than you do on your own. We&amp;#8217;ll say in most situations. Obvious a dysfunctional team won&amp;#8217;t accomplish much.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Businesses want you to be part of their team. They want to know that you put the team, their business, ahead of yourself and your own gains.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trick? Align the two.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Steps:&lt;\/strong&gt; Figure out what&amp;#8217;s good for your clients and what&amp;#8217;s good for you. Put those two in alignment and communicate that to your prospects. They&amp;#8217;ll buy in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;8. Confidence&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to work with someone that is meek and unsure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your clients probably don&amp;#8217;t want you to do whatever they tell you to do. They want to work together, but they&amp;#8217;re looking for help. They want you to be confident in what you can provide them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Confidence comes from success. It comes from believing in yourself even if you&amp;#8217;re struggling. Some of the most successful people believed in themselves even before they found success. Practice and preparation also breed confidence.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;9. Our Price Is Going Up&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could leave it simple.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When they ask why they should hire you. You can imagine that they&amp;#8217;re including the word &amp;#8220;now&amp;#8221; at the end of the question.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prices increase especially if you&amp;#8217;re a growing company. If you do what you do really well then it makes sense to increase your prices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why should a company hire or partner with you now?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because if they don&amp;#8217;t do it now they&amp;#8217;ll have to do it at a higher price later.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; Know your pricing increase schedule and use it to your advantage when getting close to sealing the deal on sales.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;10. Personal Stories&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is a crucial part of human nature.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we share stories we learn about ourselves, but it also gives people insight into our lives. We can tell people what we believe, how we work, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if we share a story from our experience it can give much more insight.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s why case studies aren&amp;#8217;t just about the numbers and results. Yes, those are important, but don&amp;#8217;t overlook the importance of the story.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Step:&lt;\/strong&gt; When creating your case studies really dive into the details of the people involved. Talk about struggle. Talk about working to find a solution. The grind. The ups and downs. Those details are convincing to potential clients because they give great insight into who you and your company are.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re in business you&amp;#8217;re going to hear this question all the time. Anytime you&amp;#8217;re selling something or marketing something you&amp;#8217;re going to need to answer this question. The best answer is usually more than one answer. Hopefully the tips above can help you define your sales process, unique selling proposition and all that good stuff.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;This question comes up if you&amp;#8217;re looking for a job, but it also comes up if you&amp;#8217;re selling.
