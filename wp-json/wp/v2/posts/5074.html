But it wasn&amp;#8217;t just a free for all. We had a list of chores to do before our parents got back home.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My thinking then and still today was to get those chores done right away in the morning. This way I didn&amp;#8217;t have to think about the thing I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do all day and once I was done I had the rest of the day to do what I wanted.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even today I still do that with work. There are things that have to get done, but that I don&amp;#8217;t necessarily enjoy and I try to do those right in the morning. Then I have the rest of the day to do the more enjoyable items on the to-do list.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#8217;m starting to think that maybe this is backwards&amp;#8230;at least sideways when it comes to running a business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The New Priority List&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m thinking that I need to focus more on the big picture with the business. It&amp;#8217;s easy to get caught doing all kinds of little things each day. They\u00a0&lt;em&gt;have&lt;\/em&gt; to get done or at least you tell yourself that and you get so busy that you don&amp;#8217;t have any time left for anything else.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes those unwanted items can even get so routine that you become good at the. And that&amp;#8217;s a bad case scenario because now you&amp;#8217;re going to do those because it&amp;#8217;s easy for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing that my focus now is to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do the things I have to do today that will save me time in the future&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And to focus on the things\u00a0today that will &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get more sales tomorrow&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I still have to prioritize making sure fires are put out and that we have a good product. But I&amp;#8217;m having a longer-term focus on those things and on the business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an example, we upload posts for most of our clients to their blog. We format and schedule the posts. I can do that in about 10 minutes each time. It&amp;#8217;s easy for me to quickly do that. I&amp;#8217;m good at it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes me an hour to document the procedure to do that for each client. Most use WordPress so the procedure is similar, but there are always little differences.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The old way of thinking would be to just do it. But creating a procedure and having the writer upload it each week saves me a ton of time in the future.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s another example, I respond to a lot of emails each day. Well, it&amp;#8217;s probably not too bad, but it&amp;#8217;s a good portion of my dad. I&amp;#8217;m working on shutting down the email and replying at only two times each day. I would like to cut that back to even once per day if I could.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I could respond to those emails, which are inquiries, questions from current customers and questions from writers. Those are all very important.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But more important is growing the business or thinking about ways to make the business and the service better. So I&amp;#8217;m prioritizing bigger picture things first now. Or at least trying too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Starting The Day With Something Fun&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;ve found that if I start the day with something fun that I&amp;#8217;m in a better frame of mind. I like doing crosswords in the morning. I like reading a chapter in a book or reading some &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/longreads.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Longreads&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;ve been starting my day off that way. Then I get into The New Priority List. I&amp;#8217;m still in the early stages, but things are getting more productive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the more timely items still get done and people are still happy. I realized that a lot of the pressure that comes from the business I was putting on myself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The best entrepreneurs and business people I know seem to have the ability to think about the big picture. They will certainly do the unwanted work too, but only after they get more important things done.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I should have been doing back when I was a kid was thinking about how I could save time in the long run with those chores. Maybe spend an hour brainstorming a faster way to rake the yard instead of just doing it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I&amp;#8217;m hopefully learning that lesson now and I think it will lead to good things.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;So I used to think it was best to do the most unwanted thing first in the morning.
