But it\u2019s true. We are each creating our own worlds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the most challenging part for most is accepting that no matter what we might be experiencing, we\u2019ve had a hand in creating it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than obsessing over what has happened, however, your energy would be better spent changing your course for the better. Here\u2019s how.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Use Your Attention Wisely&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you give your attention to expands.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Try very hard not to think of a pink elephant right now. What did you think of? A pink elephant, right? And now it\u2019s growing in your awareness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you\u2019ve given your attention to has largely determined the course of your life to this point.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two keys to using your attention wisely. Adopt these habits to take the wheel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li aria-level=\"1\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on desired outcomes&lt;\/b&gt;. Many people say they are focusing on what they want when they are either focusing on what they don\u2019t want or the absence of what they want. Your feelings will always tell you whether you\u2019re really focusing on what you want, so trust your feelings.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li aria-level=\"1\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on new things&lt;\/b&gt;. Very rarely do we put our attention on anything other than what is in front of us. It becomes a habit. No wonder our lives often appear monotonous and repetitive. Try putting your attention on the trees outside the window, your car\u2019s steering wheel or the cat wandering the neighborhood. Practice putting your attention on things you wouldn\u2019t normally set it on and do this often.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Embrace Seemingly \u201cNegative\u201d Events&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve observed that the most successful people tend to embrace every circumstance or event as positive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And on my personal development journey, I eventually came to understand that all events are neutral. We\u2019re the ones labeling them as either \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, we need to condition our habitual responses to \u201cnegative\u201d events, as they may very well be bringing us in the direction of our desires.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll say it another way \u2013 &lt;i&gt;breakdowns are always opportunities for breakthroughs&lt;\/i&gt;!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When something \u201cbad\u201d happens, say \u201cThis is good,\u201d even if you don\u2019t know how or why. Don\u2019t let the event disrupt your joy, Zen, or calm. If you are focused on the right things, trust that you\u2019re on the shortest path to getting what you want, and that some turbulence on the ride is inevitable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Trust Your Imagination&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard that the mind can\u2019t tell the difference between reality and imagination? It\u2019s true.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many professional athletes are known to use visualization techniques along with regular practice to prepare for competitions. And those who do both are inevitably more effective than those who only do one or the other.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut why does it seem like my visualizations never become reality?\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is usually, \u201cBecause you\u2019ve doubted your imagination.\u201d If you do not doubt your imagination, it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;\/i&gt;reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is no need to change reality by force. This tends to create more resistance, making it difficult to set yourself on a desired path. All that\u2019s required is faith. So, once you\u2019ve made your wish, go on your way. Get back to work. Live your life as normal. Because whatever you\u2019ve asked for is already reality. There\u2019s no need to try to control the process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we have a hard time believing it. But it\u2019s true.
