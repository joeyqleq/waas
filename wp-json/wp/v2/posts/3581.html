I&amp;#8217;m a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that&amp;#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It&amp;#8217;s not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it&amp;#8217;s not $500 either.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;2.\u00a0The Great Gatsby&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Great-Gatsby-Scott-Fitzgerald\/product-reviews\/0743273567\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;A Monument in Audio Book History&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, a monumental talent who only occasionally got things working right, made Gatsby great by the extraordinary invention of Nick Carraway. Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch: more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal &amp;#8212; always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald&amp;#8217;s enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled. Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab&amp;#8217;s speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about. But there is much more here than historical accuracy. Scourby&amp;#8217;s voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral&amp;#8217;s text with both an actor&amp;#8217;s professionalism and a good reader&amp;#8217;s care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history. It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;3.\u00a0Psychonauts&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Double-Fine-Productions-41025Psychonauts1-Psychonauts\/product-reviews\/B007XWH75O\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Incredible Game&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an incredible game in a time where innovation loses out to the every year triple-a titles. It is obvious from the start with the art direction, voice acting and overall design that this game is a winner, and is deserving of five stars.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, if you use the Steam client, you can enter the game code from Amazon, and the game will be added to your Steam library.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;4.\u00a0Air Patriots&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amazon-Digital-Services-Inc-Patriots\/product-reviews\/B008KE3960\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Lots of fun!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I got this the day it came out on both my Kindle Fire &amp;amp; Android phone. It&amp;#8217;s been a lot of fun to play and very enjoyable. The only minus is that your games only sync on the Kindle devices and not other Android devices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;5.\u00a0Marvel Ultimate Spider-Man Ultra Strike Spider-Man&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Marvel-Ultimate-Spider-Man-Strike-Figure\/product-reviews\/B00AKDJUQ2\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Ultimate spider-man!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE FIGURE!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.

It has a ton of space and I filled it all! It was very easy to attach to the roof of my SUV and stayed put the entire drive. The only down side to it was that when I was securing it to the top one of the straps broke so I just tied to the rack instead and had no problems. For the price it definitely gave me a great deal more storage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;7.\u00a0Columbia Men&amp;#8217;s Watertight Jacket&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Columbia-RM2135-Mens-Watertight-Jacket\/product-reviews\/B00365F9G6\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Effective and Great for the Price&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just got back from a Kilimanjaro hike where we had rain and\/or snow for half of our trip, and the jacket worked great&amp;#8211;no seam problems, and repelled water as advertised. My hiking buddy spent ten times the price on his jacket from another company, but didn&amp;#8217;t get any real benefit. Good buy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;8.\u00a0Yamaha ATS-1010BL&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Yamaha-ATS-1010BL-Factory-Refurbished-Surround\/product-reviews\/B0077HED8O\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Surprisingly rich sound&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Got this to augment the sound coming from our 52&amp;#8243; LCD TV, which has meager speakers. HD set top box and Blu-ray player connected to the Yamaha with optical toslink cables. For action movies the sound has good punch with the bass remaining tight and manages to fill all corners of a spacious open floor plan living room-kiitchen area. Shows with dialogue emphasis get the &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; option and this works very well. Now, understand that this will not sound as good as a true home theater surround system consisting of a receiver\/amplifier, 5 or 7 speakers and a subwoofer; but for a simple, elegant setup, the Yamaha performs admirably. Highly recommended.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;9.\u00a0Samsung Galaxy S4, Black&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Samsung-Galaxy-S4-Black-Sprint\/product-reviews\/B00CEKXJ3Y\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Blows the competition out of the water!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3&amp;#8217;s design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3&amp;#8217;s design then you will love the S4&amp;#8217;s design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;10.\u00a0LG Electronics 60LA6200 60-Inch Smart TV&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LG-Electronics-60LA6200-60-Inch-LED-LCD\/product-reviews\/B00BB9OOLK\/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great 3D TV&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I was not sold on getting a 3D TV but I am glad I got this one. It is easy to control and uses regular 3D glasses like in the movies. I saved a couple of glasses from the theatres and they work well with this TV. Picture was bright and sound was good. I mounted it on my wall and it looks great. Does convert 2D to 3D quite well to my surprise. Looked at other models and read the reviews and this one won hands down and I can see why. I use to own a Sony Bravia and that was a disaster. If you are looking for an affordable 3D TV, this is it without costly 3D glasses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some customers are very thorough in their assessment of the items they purchase. That&amp;#8217;s a good thing for companies. You can figure out what part of your merchandise or service is doing well and where you can improve. Your most vocal customers might not be the ones you can win over completely, but they can help you figure out what how improve your business.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also note the details customers will share about their experiences with the items. Some will paint a picture of exactly how they use the product &amp;#8211; more great information for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overstock&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;11.\u00a0Caravan Canopy Beige Zero-Gravity Chairs&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.overstock.com\/Home-Garden\/Patio-Furniture\/714\/cat.html?sort=Top+Sellers#Sports-Toys\/Caravan-Canopy-Beige-Zero-Gravity-Chairs-Pack-of-Two\/5333766\/product.html?refccid=P26ZTJVL5R7ZNZSK3PWKCDTLXI&amp;amp;searchidx=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great deal!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My husband &amp;amp; I have wanted to buy this type of chair for a few years now. I got these as an anniversary gift for him &amp;amp; he was very pleased. They are constructed well &amp;amp; got here in just a few days. My only complaint is that I wish they were a little bigger. I&amp;#8217;m 5&amp;#8217;4&amp;#8243; with an average build &amp;amp; they fit me perfectly. My husband is 6&amp;#8242; tall &amp;amp; he wishes they were a bit longer, but he&amp;#8217;s definitely happy. So glad I found these!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;12.\u00a0Chevron 20&amp;#215;20-inch Cotton Pillow&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.overstock.com\/Home-Garden\/Decorative-Accessories\/248\/cat.html?sort=Top+Sellers#Home-Garden\/Chevron-20x20-inch-Cotton-Pillow\/6731570\/product.html?refccid=YI6LOF3CD7LZWDCNGFRSDD2TWY&amp;amp;searchidx=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Nice Quality&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These pillows were nicer than I expected. The fill is actually duck feathers, so they are soft, but hold their shape nicely. Also, the zippers are hidden and appear to be of good quality. Be aware that the back side of the pillow is white, something to consider if the throw pillows are for a high-traffic area. So far, I&amp;#8217;m pleased. Will have to see how the color holds up to washing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;13.\u00a0Keurig B130 Commercial DeskPro&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.overstock.com\/Home-Garden\/Appliances\/245\/cat.html?sort=Top+Sellers#Home-Garden\/Keurig-B130-Commercial-DeskPro-Gourmet-Single-Cup-Brewing-System\/6420928\/product.html?refccid=WSDUZOKDD6T3R72INYC2HJPHHA&amp;amp;searchidx=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great coffee-wish it would hold a little more water&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Love Keurig. Have a larger one at home. This one makes one cup of coffee at a time and you have to add the water separately for each cup of coffee. Not an idea situation for home but for my office, where this one is, it is great. Keeps water for becoming stagnant and my co-workers can use it too. Only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to see different is that I wish it would hold a few more ounces of water so each cup could have more liquid. Still it is a great machine for the office and it was a great price.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;14.\u00a0Verena Contoured Leveled Display Cabinet\/ Bookcase&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.overstock.com\/Home-Garden\/Living-Room-Furniture\/713\/cat.html?sort=Top+Sellers#Home-Garden\/Verena-Contoured-Leveled-Display-Cabinet-Bookcase\/4105090\/product.html?refccid=UI3FIUIYVL7LXH2CUCWLV66YEQ&amp;amp;searchidx=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Sturdy&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent bookcase, display case, very sturdy, nice design.

You want to hear what people really think of your items and your company. The details provide the best learning experience, which will move your company forward.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The thing with reviews is that if one person is saying something you know there are many more feeling the same way that haven&amp;#8217;t expressed their opinions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cabela&amp;#8217;s&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;21.\u00a0G5 Montec\u2122 Broadheads&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.cabelas.com\/product\/Hunting\/Archery\/Broadheads-Points\/Fixed-Blade%7C\/pc\/104791680\/c\/104693580\/sc\/104237280\/i\/103855680\/G5-Montec8482-Broadheads\/745772.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffixed-blade%2F_%2FN-1100028%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_103855680%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253Bcat104791680%253Bcat104693580%253Bcat104237280&amp;amp;WTz_l=SBC%3Bcat104791680%3Bcat104693580%3Bcat104237280%3Bcat103855680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Simple and Deadly&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have one major philosphy when it comes to bow hunting. Keep it simple. The less you have to think about, the better chance you have to stick one of those wily deer. This broadhead is one piece, no moving parts, or blades to replace. It is amazingly easy to sharpen. It flies true and is deadly. This montec punched right through my pope and young 10 pointer this year and left a nice trail.

By reading reviews you get some insight into the exact person that&amp;#8217;s buying from you. This allows you to make your products better, but you can also use that information to target new customers that fit the same definitions as your current customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can determine if you&amp;#8217;re fading away from the target customer you want to target.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wayfair&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;31.\u00a0Euro Pro Shark Shark Navigator Pro Lift &amp;#8211; Away Vacuum&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wayfair.com\/Euro-Pro-Shark-Shark-Navigator-Pro-Lift-Away-Vacuum-NV356E-SAK1047.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Nice compact vacuum&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the flexibility of the vacuum.

It could be the message or even the image you&amp;#8217;re showing online.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Part of business is setting the proper expectations with customers. You can&amp;#8217;t always help how customers expect your products to be when they arrive, but you can change your marketing to give a realistic view of what customers should expect.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banana Republic&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;41.\u00a0Sleek suit skirt&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=30924&amp;amp;vid=2&amp;amp;pid=304458022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great Work Skirt&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love the fabric on this skirt it very soft, lays flat and is lined and very flattering.

I got size 0 petite and it fits perfectly. I don&amp;#8217;t think the petite sizes are even offered online. It&amp;#8217;s not a tight fit but slight A-line. I would recommend.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;47.\u00a0Contrast Silk Blouse&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=95285&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=558832032\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Love the contrast!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was so excited to receive this blouse. However, when it came, and I tried it on, it was a little too tight across the bust. The contrasting colors are a plus, but I expected the silk to be a little softer. It felt kind of stiff. I am sorry to have to return it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;48.\u00a0Camden-Fit Red Print Ankle Pant&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=67593&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=558998002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great Pants!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Love these pants, going to wear them with a black v-neck sweater and silver shoes for a little bit of a pop!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;49.\u00a0Floral-Print Roll-Sleeve Shirtdress&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=67593&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=560765002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Much Prettier in Person&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d seen this dress online several times and never gave it a second look. The model looks good, but the pattern seems a bit busy. Then yesterday I was in the store and it caught my eye. The pattern is beautiful. I bought the 4, but when I got home and tried it on again, it seemed a little tight in the chest. When I&amp;#8217;m standing normally it&amp;#8217;s fine, but if I put my shoulders back and stick out my chest the buttons pull a little. I don&amp;#8217;t put my shoulders back that often, so it probably won&amp;#8217;t ever be an issue, but I went ahead and ordered the 6 so I can compare.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;50.\u00a0Houndstooth V-Back Shell&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=91590&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=556453012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Has anyone else noticed?&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s not only me that has noticed the model is wearing this shirt backwards, right?? It states v-back and round neck and there is even darting shown in the back of the shirt on the model that belongs in the front. Very funny! I ordered it because I like the pattern and color of the shell. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it works&amp;#8230; Maybe it can be worn both ways! How versatile BR, love it!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;51.\u00a0Ponte Short-Sleeve Peplum Top&lt;\/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/bananarepublic.gap.com\/browse\/product.do?cid=5042&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=685820012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Great Top, One Exception&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love this top with the exception of the acetate facing. The fit was perfect and the material is great. I would rather of had a top stitch then the acetate facing inside as this rode up and bothered me that it was showing. I was going to buy the Blue but the color was so off from the self to the lining that showed. Great style though.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fashion customers can have specific tastes in style, but they also place a high importance on quality and comfort. Notice the details these customers mentioned. For fashion it&amp;#8217;s often in the details. You can use that in your marketing to make the connection.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/42931449@N07\/5397530925\/in\/photolist-9dXKU2-7CB3uR-foNHkM-d8xq35-b5wN6R-cyu1p1-ahZCzj-cjxpjd-a3XC9d-9M2Au1-8HwGLD-8b5cXb-ddenTK-8Jv9D6-9VQX4D-9c5D86-dTEStB-dcEPYs-bqedSU-9L4Sjd-7QQvKa-7MRMRH-axGPic-9rUfK3-e28Kit-cc1fDG-b2tycR-ayXKNp-dPcqJ1-dm6xYL-dbxevj-9BkQ7m-87qZHS-fqTwRx-ddes5v-bfBSDa-aC2m2T-9MY1Gf-dbLqjU-daAeDB-dajrRM-b22qKD-8dxY2p-9b38hV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;photosteve101&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&lt;p&gt;To understand your customer you need to understand their language and the reasons why they make purchases.
